[[Reinforcing Fiber]] manufactured via [[Extrusion]] of the glass melt.

# Advantages

- high dimensional stability 
- good fire resistance, not inflammable 
- good moisture and chemical resistance 
- good strength-to-weight ratio for low priced applications 
- low price (E- and S-Glass): 2-8 €/kg 
- high elongation compared to carbon#

# Disadvantages

- lower [[Modulus of Elasticity|Young´s Modulus]] compared to [[Carbon Fiber|carbon]]/aramid 
- higher heat expansion than other fiber
