Quantitatively most important group of [[Matrix Material|matrix systems]]

- Comparatively small proportion of [[Plastic Material|plastics]]
- Differ from thermoplastics both in chemical structure and processing technology
- Cross-linked polymer with 3-D-network structure
- [[Atomic Bonding#Covalent Bonding|Covalent bonds]] linking the chains
- Comparatively [[Stiffness|stiff]] and [[Toughness|brittle]]
- [[Temperature]] and media resistant
- Non-meltable
- When [[Heat]] is applied, the intermolecular (physical) bonds are loosened
- Chemical bonds prevent the chains from slipping off
- Too much [[Heat]] -> thermal decomposition of the main valence bonds
- The actual material is created from various components in a chemical reaction during [[Material Processing|processing]]

# Typical Components

- Inhibitor (decrease of the reaction speed)

# Important Thermosets

- Melamine resin (MF) 
- Urea resin (UF) 
- Unsaturated polyester resins (UP) 
- Silicone resins (SI) 
- Vinyl ester resin (VE) 
- Polyurethan (PUR) 
- Polyimides (PI) 
- Bismaleimides (BI) 
- Poly Methacryl Imide (PMI)

# Curing

![[Pasted image 20240625145500.png|500]]

1. Start of Curing: starting materials are monomers and oligomers, respectively![[Pasted image 20240625145106.png|300]]
2. Linear growth and branching of molecules (~50% degree of curing)![[Pasted image 20240625145141.png|300]]
3. Formation of gelled but incompletely cross-linked network ![[Pasted image 20240625145209.png|300]]
4. Fully cured thermoset polymer ![[Pasted image 20240625145248.png|300]]


- Chemical conversion when reaching the gel point varies from resin to resin 
	- Unsaturated polyester resin -> only 5-10 % of the reactive double bonds 
	- Epoxy resin -> 60-70 % of the epoxy groups 
- Different conversion results from the different molecular structure 
- UP-resins have comparatively long chains with many double bonds -> molecular mobility drops drastically, even if only a few of them are cross-linked 
- Epoxy molecules are short and only have two epoxy groups each -> viscosity only increases when a large number of molecules have already cross-linked with each other

## Curing Methods

### Warm-Curing

resin + hardener -> triggering of the curing reaction by heat

### Cold-Curing

resin + hardener + accelerator -> triggering by accelerator decay (time)

### Light-Curing

resin + hardener + accelerator -> triggering by accelerator decay (UV-light)

# Advantages

- Good fiber wetting due to low viscosity 
- Good compression properties 
- Resistant to creep 
- Good [[Fatigue]] properties 
- Formable into complex shapes 
- Liquid-resin manufacturing feasible 
- Highly resistant to solvents

# Disadvantages

- Long processing time 
- Long cure(~1-2 h) 
- Restricted storage life (could require refrigeration) 
- Low [[Ductility]] 
- Low fracture [[Toughness]] 
- Low impact resistance 
- Absorb moisture 
- Limited shelf life 
- Can not be directly recycled, because they can't be melted
