Hadley cells are convection currents in [[Earth's Atmosphere]] that for due to regional [[Temperature]] differences. 

Heated air in a hot area rises due to expansion, drawing in cooler air from the surroundings. The heated air then cools and subsides over the cooler area completing the cycle.

- Heating of air masses in equatorial regions 
- [[Vaporization|Evaporation]] (latent [[Heat]]) -> rising air -> low [[Pressure]] (= lower air pressure at sea level) -> inflowing masses of air from higher latitudes 
- Rising air cools down ([[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]] cooling): [[Condensation|condensation]] (release of latent heat) -> clouds + precipitation (rain forests) 
- Large part moves towards poles, cools down, sinks down
