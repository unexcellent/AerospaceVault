If an [[Electric Field]] $E$ is applied to a [[Semiconductor]] a [[Force|force]] acts on the charge carriers.
Electrons move against the field direction, holes with the field direction.

The charge carriers are not accelerated arbitrarily in this process, since they are scattered by the crystal grid. This results in a constant average charge carrier velocity $v$ which is coupled to the field strength by the charge carrier mobility $Î¼$:
$$
v_{n} = -\mu_{n} \cdot E \qquad v_{p} = -\mu_{p} \cdot E
$$
-> $v$: Charge carrier velocity
-> $\mu$: [[Charge Carrier Mobility]]
-> $E$: [[Electric Field]]

The [[Current Density]] of the charge carriers are given by
$$
s_{\text{drift}, n} = q \cdot n \cdot \mu_{n} \cdot E \qquad s_{\text{drift}, p} = q \cdot p \cdot \mu_{p} \cdot E
$$
-> $s$: [[Current Density]]
-> $q$: Elementary charge constant
-> $n$: Electron density
-> $p$: Hole density
-> $\mu$: [[Charge Carrier Mobility]]
-> $E$: [[Electric Field]]

With the total drift current density defined by:
$$
s_{\text{drift}} = s_{\text{drift}, n} + s_{\text{drift}, p} = G \cdot E
$$
-> $s$: [[Current Density]]
-> $G$: [[Electrical Conductivity]]
-> $E$: [[Electric Field]]
