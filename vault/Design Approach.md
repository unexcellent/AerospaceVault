# Function Allocation

- Clearly assign partial functions
	- with their input and output values
	- within a functional structure
- Ensure an ordered energy, force, material and signal flow through the selected structure.
- Ensure a low number of clear and consequential links of partial functions.
- Ensure defined expansion directions and possibilities.

- Definition of a clear load condition
	- static, dynamic loads
- Design the component such that the stress condition is always clear
- Choose geometric forms which comply with the mathematical approaches of strength and elasticity theory:
	- Frameworks, truss constructions

# Assembly and Transport

- Specify mandatory assembly sequence to exclude mistakes
- Perform setting procedures only once, avoid correction to assembled parts
	- Setting procedure with gauges
- Consider stresses occurring during assembly and transport in the structure design process:
	- Assembly by cranes
	- Suitable for transport
	- Contact surfaces, lifting points

# Maintainability

- Inspection and maintenance must be possible with the fewest possible different aids and tools
	- Reduction of lubricants
	- Use of standard tools
- Reduce effort for inspections and maintenance as far as possible
	- Easy access
	- Allow visual checks, where possible
- Make procedures clear, and deviations easily recognizable
	- Plan for consumables
	- Wear indication

# How to approach the design of a part?

- In [[Computer Aided Design|CAD]] and [[Technical Drawings|Technical Drawing]] there are multiple ways to get to the final part:
	- None is right or wrong, but
	- Different approaches may better deal with certain aspects
- Aspects, that might be considered in the design:
	- Easy adaptation to new dimensions
	- Re-use of existing parts
	- Manufacturing techniques

## Top-Down Approach

The Top-Down Approach is mostly used, once
- The detail design of the individual components is still unclear.
- The form/functionality is driven by the “outer shape”
- The production process is based on high speciality with dedicated manufacturing
- Low number of variants or high weight efficiency

## Bottom-Up Approach

The Bottom-Up is considered beneficial, if
- The design is based on a higher number of existing/standard parts.
- The production process is based on limited specialized parts and rather assembly than machining
- Larger number of variants with high degree of commonality are considered.
