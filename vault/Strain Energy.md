Symbol: $\Pi$

Strain energy is stored in a loaded body. The unloaded the body performs [[Mechanical Work]] of the same amount, but with a positive sign.
$$
\Pi = -W_{i} = W_{a}
$$
-> $W_{i}$: [[Internal Work]]
-> $W_{a}$: [[External Work]]

In quasi-static deformation processes, the work $W_{a}$ of all external [[Force|forces]] is equal to the strain energy.

$$
\Pi = \sum_{i} \frac{S_{i}^{2} \cdot l_{i}}{2 E_{i} A_{i}}
$$
-> $S_{i}$: [[Force]] inside truss $i$
-> $l_{i}$: length of truss $i$
-> $E_{i}$: [[Modulus of Elasticity]] of truss $i$
-> $A_{i}$: cross-sectional area of truss $i$
