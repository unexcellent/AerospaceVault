The state of a [[Thermodynamic System]] is defined by specifying values of a set of measurable properties sufficient to determine all other properties.

# Extensive Property

Properties are additive
$$
Z = \sum_{i} Z_{i}
$$

# Intensive Property

Properties are independent of the quantity of matter
$$
Z = Z_{1} = Z_{2} = \dots = Z_{n}
$$

# Molar Property

[[Thermodynamic State#Extensive Property|Extensive properties]] over number of particles
$$
z_{m} = \frac{Z}{n}
$$
Molar properties ar [[Thermodynamic State#Intensive Property|intensive]].

# Specific Property

[[Thermodynamic State#Extensive Property|Extensive properties]] per unit [[Mass]]
$$
z = \frac{Z}{m}
$$
Specific properties ar [[Thermodynamic State#Intensive Property|intensive]].
