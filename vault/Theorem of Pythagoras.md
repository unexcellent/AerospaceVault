If the length of the catheti of a right-angled triangle are denoted by $a$ and $b$ and the length of the hypothenuse is denoted by $c$, then $a^2+b^2=c^2$

# Proof

$$
\begin{align}
A = (a+b)^2 = c^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} ab \\
\Leftrightarrow a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = c^2 + 2ab\\
\Leftrightarrow a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{align}
$$
