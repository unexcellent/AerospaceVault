# Cycle

![[Pasted image 20240819161734.png|400]]
- **1 → 2**: [[Isothermal Process|Isothermal]] expansion at $T = T_{in}$ 
- **2 → 3**: [[Adiabatic Process|Adiabatic]], [[Thermodynamic Process#Reversible Process|reversible]] expansion, $T$ decreases from $T_{in}$ to $T_{out}$ 
- **3 → 4**: [[Isothermal Process|Isothermal]] compression at $T = T_{out}$ 
- **4 → 1**: [[Adiabatic Process|Adiabatic]], [[Thermodynamic Process#Reversible Process|reversible]] compression, $T$ increases from $T_{out}$ to $T_{in}$

# Two Phase

The two phase Carnot cycle operates using [[Phase]] transitions.

## Efficiency

The [[Thermal Efficiency]] can be written as
$$
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_{L}}{T_{H}} = \frac{(h_{2} - h_{1}) + (h_{4} - h_{3})}{h_{2} - h_{1}}
$$
