Energy, that enables a body to perform [[Mechanical Work|work]], after a [[Force]] acted on it.
The resulting potential energy is only dependent on the start and end parameters and not the path between them.
$$
V = \int_{0}^{x} F(x) \ dx

# Elastic Potential

- Elastic potential is the potential energy stored in a body during deformation.

# Stability in Equilibrium

![[Pasted image 20231214095010.png]]

Necessary equilibrium condition for a system with one degree of freedom
$$
\frac{dV(q)}{dq} = 0
$$
Stable case (minimum):
$$
\frac{dV(q)}{dq} = 0 \quad \wedge \quad \frac{d^{2}V(q)}{d^{2}q} > 0
$$
Instable case (maximum):
$$
\frac{dV(q)}{dq} = 0 \quad \wedge \quad \frac{d^{2}V(q)}{d^{2}q} < 0
$$
