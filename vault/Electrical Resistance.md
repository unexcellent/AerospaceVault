Symbol: $\Omega$
# Definition

Defined by [[Ohm's Law]].

# Unit

Ohm $[\Omega]$
$$
\Omega = \frac{V}{I} 
$$
-> $V$: [[Voltage]]
-> $I$: [[Current]]

# Specific Resistance

The resistance of a conductor can be calculated using
$$
R = \rho(\vartheta) \cdot \frac{l}{A}
$$
-> $\rho$: [[Resistivity]]
-> $l$: length of the conductor
-> $A$: cross sectional area of the conductor
