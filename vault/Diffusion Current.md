Free moving particles in a volume move on average from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

The diffusion current is independent of the [[Electric Field]] or the charge of the particles.
$$
s_{\text{diff}, n} = q \cdot D_{n} \cdot \frac{dn}{dx} \qquad s_{\text{diff}, p} = q \cdot D_{p} \cdot \frac{dp}{dx}
