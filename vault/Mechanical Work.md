Symbol: $W$

Work is performed, when a [[Force]] acts over a certain distance $s$
$$
W = \langle \overrightarrow{F}, \ \overrightarrow{s} \rangle
$$
-> $F$: applied [[Force]]
-> $s$: movement vector

# Rigid Body Motion

- Rigid body motion is sum of translation and rotation
- Likewise for infinitesimal displacement
- Infinitesimal rotation $d\overrightarrow{\varphi}$ results in displacement $d\overrightarrow{u}$ perpendicular to the location vector from the rotation pole to the considered point

For an arbitrary disk point $p$ we get:
$$
du_{xp} = du_{T,x} + du_{\varphi,x} = du_{T,x} - y_{p} \cdot d\varphi
$$
$$
du_{yp} = du_{T,y} + du_{\varphi,y} = du_{T,y} + x_{p} \cdot d\varphi
$$
$$
d\varphi_{p} = d\varphi
$$
with $du_{T}$ referring to the distance change due to translation and $du_{\varphi}$ referring to the distance change due to rotation

The distance from the point $p$ to the center of rotation is
$$
r = \frac{du}{d\varphi}
$$
