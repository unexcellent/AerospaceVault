# What is CAD

- Creating [[Technical Drawings|drawings]] on a computer
- Creating 3D shapes on a computer – Visualization:
	- Checking how things fit together to make sure they don’t interfere
	- Checking whether the product can be maintained (accessibility)
	- Checking how product will look to the customer
- Providing the geometric basis to do simulations:
	- Structural Analysis
	- Animation and kinematics
	- Dynamics
	- Fluid Flow
	- Heat Transfer

# Basic Elements

## Curves

- Many curves can not be written as a single equation in terms of only x and y. In order to deal with some of these problems we introduce parametric equations.
- Instead of defining 𝑦 in terms of 𝑥 (𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)) or 𝑥 in terms of 𝑦 (𝑥=ℎ(𝑦)), we define both 𝑥 and 𝑦 in terms of a third variable called a curve parameter as follows, 𝑥=𝑓(𝑡) 𝑦=𝑔(𝑡)
- This third variable is usually denoted by t (as we did here). Sometimes we will restrict the values of 𝑡.
- Each value of 𝑡 defines a point (𝑥,𝑦)=(𝑓(𝑡),𝑔(𝑡)) that we can plot. The collection of points that we get by letting 𝑡 be all possible values is the graph of the parametric equations and is called the parametric curve.
