# Rules

## Auxiliary dimension line

- An auxiliary dimension line is a connecting line between the element to be dimensioned and the corresponding dimension line.

## Dimension line

- is a straight or curved line, which lies between two body edges, one body edge and an auxiliary dimension line or between two auxiliary dimension lines. In case of simplified dimensioning, the dimension line may also end at only one of the above elements. 

## Dimension line limitation

- is a designation on dimension lines, in order to emphasize their end. In engineering, a solid arrow with an apex angle of 15° is used for this purpose. In the event of lack of space, and in exceptional cases, a solid point may be used.

## Dimension (text):

- is a physical size, which is made up of a number and a unit of measure. The dimensions are length dimensions, specified in length units and angle dimensions, specified in angle units. The unit of measure of millimetres (mm) is generally used in engineering. A dimension without any specified unit of measure is in mm

# Entering Dimensions

- Related dimensions, e.g. individual form elements such as grooves, steps, bores are entered in one view / one section and grouped according to their relationship.
- Every dimension is entered only once − Double- and over-dimensioning is not allowed
- Dimensions for internal and external forms are entered separately
- The reading direction of the drawing corresponds to the reading direction of the text field
- All dimensions, graphic symbols and written information must be entered so, that the drawing can be read from the bottom and from the right. (Main reading directions)
- The number is placed above the dimension line

## Radius

- Radii are provided only with a dimension arrow
- Designation of the centre point, if the position must be specified for production reasons
- In case of large radii, the dimension line may be drawn shortened (rectangular bend with specification of the geometric centre point)

## Diameter

- Ø symbol both for form elements in which the circular shape is directly recognizable, and in which the circular form is represented as segment (side view)

## Sphere

- A spherical form is designated by the capital letter S (sphere)
- The S is placed before the Ø symbol or the capital letter R (radius)
- If the centre of the sphere is specified, the Ø symbol is used, otherwise the sphere radius R

## Squares 

- The corresponding symbol □ is used in both cases:
	- for form elements in which the square shape is recognisable,
	- and in which the square form is represented only as a segment (side view)
- When showing a workpiece with even, rectangular outer surfaces in a view, the even surface is designated by a diagonal cross with a narrow, full line

## Width Across Flats

- Width across flats is marked by the capital letters SW before the number
- The position of the wrench/Allen key is designated by a diagonal cross with a narrow, full line

## Chamfers / Bevels

- Chamfers and countersinks are dimensioned by the specification of the:
	- Chamfer and countersink angle and
	- Chamfer width or countersink depth
- Chamfers and countersinks with an angle of 45° may be dimensioned in simplified form
	- Dimension arrows are always positioned perpendicular to the surrounding edges of the chamfer or countersink (or their extension)
