Imperfections in the [[Lattice Structure]] of [[Crystalline Material|crystalline materials]].

Lattice defects determine many properties of the material.

# Point Defect

Point defects occur when:
- An [[Atom]] from the crystal is crowded into an interstitial site (self-interstitial atom)
- Foreign atoms are crowded in lattice (substitutional atoms) or in interstices (interstitial atoms)
- Lattice sites are not occupied (vacancies)

## Solid Solution

- Larger amounts of a second type of atom are dissolved in the lattice
- It is not possible to have a pure metal consisting of only one type of atom, impurity or foreign atoms will always be present
- Foreign atoms are intentionally inserted to impart specific characteristics to the material

# Linear Defect

- Dislocations must either:
	- Start and end at the surface of the crystal
	- Or form a loop within the crystal
- Importance of dislocations:
	- Dislocations can be created with little energy input, which gives [[Metalic Material|metals]] their [[Ductility]]
	- Cold forming creates new dislocations. Since the dislocations interfere with each other, the [[Strength]] of the material increases

## Edge Dislocation

A linear or one-dimensional defect around which some of the atoms are misaligned.

## Screw Dislocation

Topological defect of a crystal lattice formed by a shear stress that is applied to produce the distortion.

# Interfacial Defect

- Separate regions of the materials that have different crystal structures and/or crystallographic orientations
- These imperfections include external surfaces, grain boundaries, twin boundaries, stacking faults, and phase boundaries
- Grain boundaries: areas with different orientations of the lattice structure meet

- Formation of grain boundaries:
	- Material begins to crystalize when molten it is cooled
	- The individual grains grow toward each other and eventually touch
	- Atomic layers between the grains that are arranged without any rules, thus forming grain boundaries
- Importance of grain boundaries:
	- Grain boundaries block the migration of dislocations
	- Better [[Strength]] behavior

# Bulk Defects

- Bulk defects are 3-dimensional macroscopic defects or volume defects, which include pores, cracks, or inclusions
- These defects are normally introduced during processing and fabrication steps
