Symbol: $n$

[[Material]] property quantifying the [[Refraction]] of a medium when compared to the vacuum.
$$
n = \frac{c}{v} = \sqrt{\varepsilon_{r} \cdot \mu_{r}}
$$
-> $c$: [[Speed of Light]] in a vacuum
-> $v$: speed of light in the medium
-> $\varepsilon_{r}$: [[Permittivity#Relative Permittivity|relative permittivity]]
-> $\mu_{r}$: [[Permeability#Relative Permeability|relative permeability]]
