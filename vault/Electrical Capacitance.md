Symbol: $C$

# Definition

Capacitance is caused by the [[Electric Field]] and defined by the charge per [[Voltage|voltage]] or via the [[Permittivity]].
$$
C = \frac{Q}{V} = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}
$$
-> $Q$: [[Electrical Charge]]
-> $V$: [[Voltage]]
-> $\varepsilon$: [[Permittivity]]
-> $A$: Area of the capacitor
-> $d$: Distance between the capacitor plates

# Unit

Farad $[F]$:
$$
1F = 1 \frac{As}{V}
$$
