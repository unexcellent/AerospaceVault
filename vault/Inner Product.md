The inner product between two elements $v$ and $w$ of a [[Vector Space]] $V$ denotes an operation of those two elements as a precondition of a [[Hilbert Space|pre-Hilbert Space]]. It is usually denoted as $\langle v, w \rangle$ or more generally $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$.

A prominent example is the [[Vector#Euclidian Scalar Product|scalar product of two vectors.]]

# Norm

The norm of an element $v$ is defined as
$$
||v|| = \sqrt{\langle v, v \rangle}
$$

# Orthogonality

Two elements are said to be orthogonal if
$$
\langle v, w \rangle = 0
$$

# Angle

The angle $\theta$ between to elements is defined as
$$
\theta = \arccos \dfrac{\langle v, w \rangle}{||v|| \cdot ||w||}
$$
