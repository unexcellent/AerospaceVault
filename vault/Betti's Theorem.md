Synonym: Superposition Principle

Principle of [[Displacement in Bars|displacement]] due to multiple [[Force|forces]] acting on a body.

# Example

Applying a force $F_{i}$ on point $i$ leads to the displacement $f_{ii}$ at point $i$ and $f_{ki}$ at point $k$.
![[Pasted image 20240702151147.png|400]]
The work caused by $F_{i}$:
$$
W_{ii} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot F_{i} \cdot f_{i}
$$
-> $W_{ii}$: [[External Work]] produced by $F_{i}$ at point $i$

Applying an additional force $F_{k}$ at point $k$ leading to displacement $f_{kk}$ at point $k$ as well as displacement $f_{ik}$ at point $i$.
![[Pasted image 20240702152040.png|400]]
The work caused by $F_{k}$:
$$
W_{kk} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot F_{k} \cdot f_{kk}
$$
$$
W_{ik} = F_{i} \cdot f_{ik}
$$
The total work of the system is then
$$
W_{a} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot F_{i} \cdot f_{ii} 
+ \frac{1}{2} \cdot F_{k} \cdot f_{kk}
+ F_{i} \cdot f_{ik}
$$
with
$$
F_{i} \cdot f_{ik} = F_{k} \cdot f_{ki}
$$
