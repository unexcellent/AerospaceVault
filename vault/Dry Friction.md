A type of [[Friction]]

![[Pasted image 20231214100015.png|400]]

- Ideally smooth contact surfaces: only [[Force|force]] transmission perpendicular to the contact surface.
- Real bodies have surface roughness and can therefore also transmit tangential forces.
- Great importance for technical systems.
- Distinction between adhesive contact (static friction) and sliding contact (dynamic friction).

# Static Friction

A block on a slope is static due to friction, if $\alpha \le \alpha_{\max}$

-> $G$: Gravitational [[Force]] 
-> $N$: Normal [[Force]]
$$
N = G \cdot \cos \alpha
$$
-> $R$: Relative [[Force]] (direction always opposite to the direction of motion)
$$
R = G \cdot \sin \alpha
$$

System is static if
$$
|\overrightarrow{R}| \le \mu_{0} \cdot |\overrightarrow{N}| 
$$
-> $\mu_{0}$: [[Friction Coefficient#Static Friction Coefficient|static friction coefficient]]

# Sliding Friction

- Sliding friction always acts in the opposite direction to the relative velocity of the sliding surfaces. sliding surfaces
$$
\overrightarrow{R} = -|\overrightarrow{R}| \cdot \frac{v_{el}}{|v_{el}|}
$$
- The amount is independent of the amount of the relative velocity.
- The sliding friction is proportional to the normal force and independent of the size of the contact surface. The law of friction according to Coulomb is:
$$
|\overrightarrow{R}| = \mu \cdot |\overrightarrow{N}|
$$
-> $\mu$: [[Friction Coefficient#Dynamic Friction Coefficient|dynamic friction coefficient]]

# Belt Friction

![[Pasted image 20240113120915.png|500]]

The belt force depending on the angle is defined as:
$$
S(\varphi) = S_{2} \cdot e^{\mu_{0} \cdot \varphi} 
$$

The system is only static for $S_{1} > S_{2}$ if:
$$
S_{1} \le S_{2} \cdot e^{\mu_{0} \cdot \varphi} 
$$
-> $\mu_{0}$: [[Friction Coefficient#Static Friction Coefficient|static friction coefficient]]
-> $\varphi$: Angle between the two touch points of the rope and the circle
