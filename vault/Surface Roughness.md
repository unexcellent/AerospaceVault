# Roughness Measurement

## Average Roughness Values $R_{a}$

![[Pasted image 20240124103232.png]]
$$
R_{a} = \frac{1}{l_{r}} \int^{l_{r}}_{0} |z(x)|dx
$$

## Average Roughness Values $R_{z}$

![[Pasted image 20240124103329.png]]
$$
R_{z} = \dfrac{\sum^{n}_{i=1} R_{z_{i}}}{n}, \quad R_{z_{i}} = R_{p_{i}} + R_{v_{i}}
$$
-> $R_{p_i}$: biggest positive Peak
-> $R_{v_i}$: biggest negative Peak

# Surface Symbols

Used in [[Technical Drawings]]

- The surface symbols must be readable from the bottom and from the right
- The symbol is applied from the outside on the surface to be machined,
	- on an adjoining auxiliary dimension line, or
	- a reference arrow

- A machining symbol placed in the text field or at a position number applies for the complete part

- If further machining qualities occur, these must be specified explicitly on the component, and after the global machining symbol in brackets
