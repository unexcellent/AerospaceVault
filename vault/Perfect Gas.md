An [[Ideal Gas]] with [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Heat Capacity]] independent of [[Temperature]] ($c_{v}, c_{p} = \text{const.}$) is called a perfect gas.

Monoatomic gases and diatomic gases at ordinary temperatures are considered perfect gases.

The specific heat capacity values are given for **monoatomic gases** as
$$
c_{v} = \frac{3 R_{m}}{2 M}
\quad \text{and} \quad
c_{p} = \frac{5 R_{m}}{2 M}
$$
and for **diatomic gases** as
$$
c_{v} = \frac{5 R_{m}}{2 M}
\quad \text{and} \quad
c_{p} = \frac{7 R_{m}}{2 M}
$$
-> $R_{m}$: [[Universal Gas Constant]]
-> $M$: [[Molar Mass]]
