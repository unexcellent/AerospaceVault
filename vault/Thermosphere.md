The thermosphere is a layer in [[Earth's Atmosphere]] at a height of $> \pu{80km}$ from the surface. 
It is characterized by the separation of residual atmospheric [[States of Matter#Gas|gasses]] according to [[Molar Mass]].
Due to highly energetic [[Solar Radiation]], the [[Temperature]] rises with increasing altitude.
