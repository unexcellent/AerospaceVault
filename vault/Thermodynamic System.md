A thermodynamic system is an abstract space confined by system boundaries that is used for the analysis of a thermodynamic process.

# Open System 

- Boundaries are permeable for [[Mass]], work and [[Heat]] 
- Often not a physical boundary

# Closed System

- Boundaries permeable for work and [[Heat]] 
- No [[Mass]] flux to the surrounding

# Isolated System

- No [[Mass]] flux over system boundaries 
- No [[Heat]] and work exchange over boundaries â†’ Completely isolated from surroundings

# Steady System

- Properties and behavior is constant over time
- Example: Closed System
	- Cylinder containing gas is weight down by a mass
	- No energy goes in or out of the system
	- Properties (e.g. temperature, pressure) are constant over time at
- Example: Open System 
	- Water fills a bucket with a hole
	- same amount of water with fixed [[Temperature]] enters and exits the system

# Unsteady System

- Properties and behavior change over time
- Example: Closed System
	- Flame heats gas in cylinder 
	- Temperature of gas increases - Piston expands
- Example: Open System 
	- Water fills a bucket with a hole
	- different amounts of water with fixed [[Temperature]] enter and exit the system
