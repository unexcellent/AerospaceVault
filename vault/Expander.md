An expander is a device, that expands a [[Fluid]]. It is often used in [[Refrigerator|refrigeration]].

# Throttle

A throttle expands the fluid due to flow restriction, which leads to a sudden [[Pressure]] drop. No [[Thermodynamic Work|work]] is done by the device and it is approximately [[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]] and [[Isenthalpic Process|isenthalpic]].

# Turbine

A turbine decreases [[Pressure]] continuously by extracting [[Thermodynamic Work|work]] from the fluid. It is approximately [[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]], but **not** [[Isenthalpic Process|isenthalpic]].
