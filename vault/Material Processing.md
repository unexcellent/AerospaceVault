## Structural / Part Design

### Design for Manufacturability

Part design engineers need to know constraints of the production processes used -> Development of design guidelines

### Utilization of New Materials and Processes

Development / certification of new production processes open new design possibilities

## Process Planning

Process Planning involves the material flow and logistics within a production process
- Sequencing of process steps
- Decision for continuous / discontinuous production
- Required cycle times
- Resulting equipment requirements
- Material demands (for parts and auxiliaries)

## Production Planning

Production planning allocates the available production resources in order to meet the required production output requirements
- Required Personnel
	- Staff availability
	- Shift plans
- Which machines to use?
- Material supply and storage
- Purchased / Pre-produced parts
- Machine maintenance and equipping plans

## Quality Engineering

### Pre-Production

Part and Production Certification / Qualification
- PFMEA
- FAI
- ...

### During Production

- Quality assurance 
- Process monitoring 
- Approval for process changes 
- Audits

### Post-Production

Handling of customer complaints.

## Data Science

Industry 4.0: 
- Gathers large amounts of data from different sources in real-time 
- Uses these data in complex analysis and simulation tools in order to better understand and optimize production processes
