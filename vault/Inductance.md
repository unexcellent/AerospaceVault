Symbol: $L$

Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the [[Current|electric current]] flowing through it. The electric current produces a [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] around the conductor.
$$
L = \frac{N^{2}}{R_{m}}
$$
-> $N$: number of rounds in a coil
-> $R_{m}$: [[Magnetic Reluctance]]
