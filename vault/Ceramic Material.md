# Crystal Structure

Silicate ceramics have glassy and crystalline phases, oxide and non-oxide ceramics have a polycrystalline structure.

- During sintering, pores occur in ceramic materials
- Pores and inclusions limit the grain growth in the atomic structure
- Pores, inclusions and manufacturing induced defects dominate mechanical properties of ceramics
- Ceramics are composed of two or more elements
- Crystal structure in general more complex than those of metals
- Atomic bonding can be completely covalent, partial ionic or even completely ionic
- Proportion of ionic structure depends on electronegativity of atoms in the structure
- For predominantly ionic ceramics: crystal structure from positively charged metallic ions and negatively charged non-metallic ions
- Positively charged ions have smaller diameter in structural model
- Structure is influenced by two main factors
	- Magnitude of [[Electrical Charge]] of ions -> Crystal must be electrically neutral overall
	- Ration of radii of cations and anions -> Defines number of cations connected to each anion (coordination number)

- For a certain stable coordination configuration, the ratio of radii must not fall below critical value
- The higher the ratio of radii, the higher the number of possible cation-anion connections
- Most common coordination numbers for ceramic materials are 4, 6 and 8
