The energy balance is derived by the [[Laws of Thermodynamics#2nd Law|2nd law of thermodynamics]] and states that all energy transfers in a system must equal out to zero.
$$
\dot{E}_{sys} = \left( h + \frac{c^{2}}{2} + g z\right) \cdot \left( \sum_{i} \dot{m}_{i} - \sum_{o} \dot{m}_{o} \right) + \sum_{j} \dot{Q}_{j} + \sum_{k} \dot{W}_{t,k}
$$
-> $h$: [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Enthalpy]]
-> $c$: flow velocity
-> $g$: gravitational acceleration
-> $z$: potential height
-> $\dot{m}_{i}$: rate of [[Mass]] inflow
-> $\dot{m}_{o}$: rate of [[Mass]] outflow
-> $\dot{Q}$: rate of [[Heat]] change
-> $\dot{W}$: rate of [[Technical Work]] change
