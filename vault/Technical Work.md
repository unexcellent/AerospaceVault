Symbol: $W_{t}$
Unit: $J$

Technical work is [[Thermodynamic Work]] that crosses the [[Thermodynamic System|system]] boundary. 
Different to the displacement work, the system boundary remains unchanged.

# Rotatory Movement

E.g from a rotating shaft
$$
W_{t} = \int^{\varphi_{2}}_{\varphi_{1}} M \ d \varphi
$$
-> $\varphi$: [[Twist Angle]]
-> $M$: [[Moment]]

# Translatory Movement

E.g. from an oscillating shaft
$$
W_{t} = \int^{x_{2}}_{x_{1}} F_{||x} \ dx
$$
-> $x$: displacement
-> $F$: [[Force]]
