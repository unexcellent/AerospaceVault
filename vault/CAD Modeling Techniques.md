# Wireframe Modeling

Wire frame modeling is an edge or skeletal representation of a real-world 3D object using lines and curves.

## Pros

- Simple to construct for 2D and simple and symmetric 3D objects
- Designer needs little training
- System needs little memory
- Take less manipulation time
- Retrieving and editing can be easily done
- Consumes less time
- Best suitable for manipulations as orthographic isometric and perspective views.

## Cons

- Image causes confusion
- Cannot get required information from this model
- Hidden line removal features not available
- Not possible for volume and mass calculation, NC programming, cross sectioning etc.
- Not suitable to represent complex solids

# Surface Modeling

Surface models define the surface features, as well as the edges, of objects. Different types of spline curves are
used to create surface patches with different modeling characteristics.

## Pros

- It is less ambiguous.
- Complex surfaces can be easily identified.
- It removes hidden line and adds realism.

## Cons

- Difficult to construct.
- Difficult to calculate mass property.
- More time is required for creation.
- Requires high storage space as compared to wire frame modeling.
- Also requires more time for manipulation.

# Solid Modeling

Solid Modeling provides a complete representation of an object more than wireframe or surface modeling. In this
model, the appearance of an object is displayed in solid (filled) design.

## Pros

- Complete modeling.
- Unambiguous.
- Best suitable for calculating mass properties.
- Very much suitable for automated applications.
- Fast creation.
- Gives huge information.
- Close to manufacturing.

# Cons

- Requires large memory.
- Slow manipulation.
- Some manipulations can be complex and require tedious procedure.
- Required lots of detail data (that might not be available in some design stages)
