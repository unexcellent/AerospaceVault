- The advantages of [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|BJTs]] (high reverse [[Voltage|voltages]] with low forward [[Electrical Resistance|resistances]]) and [[MOSFET|MOSFETs]] (little power required for driving) are combined in the IGBTs.
- IGBTs are thus particularly suitable for high-power, high-voltage and high-[[Current|current]] applications.
- They also have three terminals: Collector (C), Gate (G) and Emitter (E).

- The structure of an IGBT consists of a Darlington circuit of a pnp-BJT and an n-channel MOSFET.
- The Darlington circuit is used when very large currents are to be switched with low powers
- The IGBT is controlled via the gate of the MOSFET: If the gate-emitter voltage VGE exceeds the threshold voltage, current flows across the BJT.

- Also here, there is a characteristic curve diagram showing the operating ranges of the IGBT.
- The IGBT operates in three ranges:
	- Reverse blocking range,
	- Linear/saturation range and
	- Active range
