Symbol: $H$

A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on [[Current|electric currents]] and magnetic [[Material|materials]].

# Around a Conductor

$$
H(r) = \frac{I}{2 \cdot \pi \cdot r}
$$
-> $I$: [[Current]]
-> $r$: distance from conductor

# Toroidal Coils

$$
H(r) = \frac{N \cdot I}{2 \cdot \pi \cdot r}
$$
-> $I$: [[Current]]
-> $r$: distance from conductor
-> $N$: number of turns in the coil

# Inside a [[Magnetic Circuit]]

$$
H = \frac{\Theta}{l}
$$
-> $\Theta$: [[Magnetomotive Force]]
-> $l$: length
