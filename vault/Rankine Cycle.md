The (Clausius-)Rankine cycle is the cycle widely used in coal-fired power plants or nuclear reactors.

# Cycle

![[Pasted image 20240829130618.png]]
Simplest version of the Rankine cycle is a 4-process cycle: 
- **1 → 2**: [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] compression of a [[States of Matter#Liquid|liquid]] in a pump 
- **2 → 4**: [[Isobaric Process|Isobaric]] [[Heat]] addition in a boiler to saturated [[States of Matter#Gas|vapor]] $(x_{4} = 1)$
- **4 → 5**: [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] expansion in a turbine, state 5 in the two-phase region $0 < x_{5} < 1$ 
- **5 → 1**: [[Isobaric Process|Isobaric]] [[Heat]] rejection in a condenser

# Efficiency

The [[Thermal Efficiency]] of the Rankine cycle can be calculated as
$$
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_{low}}{T_{m}}
$$
-> $T_{low}$: lowest [[Temperature]] in the cycle
-> $T_{m}$: [[Mean Temperature]]
