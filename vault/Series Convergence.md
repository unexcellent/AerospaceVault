A [[Series of Numbers|series]] can only converge if $\displaystyle\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k} = 0$ (see [[Limit of a Sequence]]).

The convergent value of the series can be calculated using the following formula:
$$
\sum^{\infty}_{k=k_{0}} a_{k} = \dfrac{k_{0}}{1 - \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_{k}}}
$$

# Absolute Convergence

The series $\sum_{k} a_{k}$ is said to converge absolutely if the series $\sum_{k} |a_{k}|$ also converges.
