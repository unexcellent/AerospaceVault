Symbol: $\underline{S}$

In an AC circuit with several passive components the addition of [[Active Power]] and [[Reactive Power]] is called apparent power.

$$
\underline{S} = P_{avg} + j \cdot Q
$$
-> $P_{avg}$: [[Active Power]]
-> $Q$: [[Reactive Power]]
-> $j$: [[Complex Number|complex unity]]

# Apparent Load Power

$$
\underline{S}_{\text{Load}} = R_\text{Load} \cdot I^{2} + j X_\text{Load} \cdot I^{2}
