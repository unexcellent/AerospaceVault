Basic requirements of design theory:
- Functionality
- Safety
- Simplicity
- Clarity
- Feasibility (economic)

Objective:
- Fulfillment of the technical function, taking into account economic feasibility and safety of people and the environment

# Safety

- Reliable fulfillment of the technical function.
- Avoidance of danger to people and environment, through
	- Direct safety: The chosen solution avoids any danger
	- Indirect safety: [[Design Approach|Design]] and arrangement of protective systems
	- Illustrative safety: Warning of danger, e.g. warning signs, pictograms

# Simplicity

- Reduce the number of parts,
- Trade-off needed between:
	- Total production numbers
	- Production costs
	- Number of variants
	- Maintainability aspects

# Clarity

- Effectiveness and behavior have to be predictable.
- Consider working conditions:
	- Load (nominal and off-design)
	- Physical, thermal, dynamic loads
	- Degrees of freedom
