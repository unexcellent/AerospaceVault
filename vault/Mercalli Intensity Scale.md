| VII   | Slight to moderate damage in well-built structures; considerable damage in poorly built structures; some chimneys broken                            |
| VIII  | Considerable damage in well-built structures. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. |
| IX    | Damage great in well-built structures, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations.                                                    |
