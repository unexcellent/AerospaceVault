The greenhouse effect describes a process in which [[Electromagnetic Radiation|radiation]] - mainly in the infrared spectrum - that is emitted from the [[Earth]] is absorbed and reflected inside the [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmosphere]] due to natural greenhouse gases.
This leads to a heating effect on the atmosphere.

| Gas                     | Effect as a greenhouse gas |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Water vapour            | $\pu{50-60\%}$             |
| CO<sub>2</sub>          | $\pu{25-30\%}$             |
| Ozone                   | $\approx \pu{8\%}$         |
| Methane, NO<sub>X</sub> | $<\pu{1\%}$                |

# Anthropogenic Greenhouse Effect

Amplification of natural greenhouse effect due to additional human-induced input of greenhouse gases, which increase the back-radiation properties of the atmosphere.
