The ozone layer is a thin layer of Ozone mainly in [[Earth's Atmosphere]]. 
It is compressed down to a $\pu{3mm}$ thick slap with a high concentration, that is mainly located in the [[Stratosphere]].

# Depletion

The emission of chloro-fluoro-carbons by humans have acted as a catalyst, that splits the ozone molecules leading to depletion. However, the banning of such chemicals has lead to the slow regeneration of the ozone layer.
