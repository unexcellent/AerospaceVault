-> $S$: [[Entropy]]
-> $U$: [[Internal Energy]]
-> $V$: [[Volume]]
-> $H$: [[Enthalpy]]
-> $F$: [[Helmholtz Free Energy]]
-> $p$: [[Pressure]]
-> $G$: [[Gibbs Energy]]
-> $T$: [[Temperature]]

Coefficients are opposite corners of the potential.
Differentials are the opposite corners of coefficients.
