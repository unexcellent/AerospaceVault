Electrochemical phenomenon that causes destructive and unintentional attack of a [[Metalic Material|metal]].

Involves two dissimilar materials that are placed in electrical contact with each other in the presence of an electrolyte.

# Corrosion Rate


- Half-cell potentials are thermodynamic parameters for systems at equilibrium - real corroding systems are not at equilibrium 
- Half-cell potentials can be used to know the tendency for the occurrence of a particular cell reaction, but gives no information about corrosion rates 
- Rate of material removal as a consequence of chemical reaction 
- For most applications CPR = 0,5 mm/year is acceptable, but not for aerospace
