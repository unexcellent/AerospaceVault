# 0th Law

For every [[Thermodynamic System]] in equilibrium there exists a property called [[Temperature]]. Equality of temperature is a necessary and sufficient condition for thermal equilibrium.

# 1st Law

For every [[Thermodynamic System]] there exists a property called energy. The energy of a system can only change through energy transport across its boundaries.

# 2nd Law

For every [[Thermodynamic System]] there exists a property called [[Entropy]], which describes the disorder in the system. If the system is closed the entropy can only stay constant or increase.
