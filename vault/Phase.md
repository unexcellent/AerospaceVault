In thermodynamics, a phase is a quantity of matter that is homogenous throughout. A phase has locally uniform thermodynamic, chemical, and physical properties and can be mechanically separated from its surroundings.

# Single Phase - Homogeneous 

Pure substance
- Same molecules
- Same state of matter 

Dry [[States of Matter#Gas|gas]]
- Homogenous mixture of various gases

# Multiple Phases - Heterogeneous

Matter in more than one state of matter
- Same molecules
- One phase per state of matter (continuous) 

[[States of Matter#Gas|Gas]] with [[States of Matter#Liquid|liquid]] particles
- e.g. Fog (Air + Water droplets) 

[[States of Matter#Gas|Gas]] with [[States of Matter#Solid|solid]] particles
- e.g. Air + Soot 

Immiscible [[States of Matter#Liquid|liquids]]
- Oil on water (2 continuous phases)

# Phase Diagram

The phase diagram displays the phase of a substance at different [[Pressure|pressures]] and [[Temperature|temperatures]].
