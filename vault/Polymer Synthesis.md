# Polymerization

- Monomers with double bonds react
- Degree of polymerization: number of monomeric units combined to form a polymer
- Chain reaction: once initiated, only stops by termination reaction or a lack of monomers
- Examples: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), [[Polyethylene]] (PE) and [[Polystyrene]] (PS)

# Polycondensation

- Premise: monomers have at least 2 functional reactive groups
- Addition of monomers at the reactive end groups
- Chemical balanced reaction
- Termination by controlling of temperature and starting material concentration
- Examples: Polyamides (PA), Phenol

# Polyaddition

- Needs at least 2 different monomers
- Intramolecular rearrangement: hydrogen atoms that can be released from functional groups are shifted to another molecule â†’ covalent bonds cause the molecules to link
- Chemical stage reaction
- Termination by lack of starting material
- Examples: Polyurethanes (PU), Epoxy (EP)
