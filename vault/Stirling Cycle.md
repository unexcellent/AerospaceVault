The Stirling cycle is a fully [[Thermodynamic Process#Reversible Process|reversible]] cycle that approaches the [[Carnot Cycle]] in more realisable processes, using an [[Internal Regenerator|internal regeneration]] heat transfer.
Resulting Stirling engines are external [[Heat Engine|heat engines]].

# Types

## Alpha Type

![[Pasted image 20240823213226.png|200]]
- 2 cylinders (1 hot, 1 cold)
- pistons connected to a flywheel
- gas is driven between the two cylinders, going through a regenerator

## Beta Type

![[Pasted image 20240823213417.png|200]]
- 1 cylinder (hot end, cold end)
- Power piston and displacer piston connected to a flywheel
- Gas is heated at hot end - power piston goes up 
- Displacer pushes hot gas to cold side, gas is cooled, power piston goes down

## Gamma Type

![[Pasted image 20240823213456.png|300]]
- 2 connected cylinders (power cylinder, displacement cylinder) 
- Power piston and displacer piston connected to a flywheel 
- Works like Beta type
