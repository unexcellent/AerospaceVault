Part of the [[Thermoset]]-group.

# Properties

- Aromatic polyimides exhibit the highest heat resistance 
- High [[Strength]] and [[Stiffness]], above 150 째C they are stronger than [[Aluminum#Alloys|aluminum alloys]] 
- Very good wear and sliding behavior 
- Polyimides are used both as thermoplastics and thermosets 
- Can be used for short periods up to [[Temperature|temperatures]] of max. 650째C 
- Continuous temperature limits of 260 째C (in air) and 315 째C in inert atmosphere 
- Amber to dark brown appearance 
- Self-extinguishing

# Applications

- Mechanical engineering and vehicle construction 
- Aviation and aerospace 
- Electronics
