Process of influencing the microstructure of [[Ferrous Metal]] to change the properties using precise control of [[Temperature]].

Process:
1. Heat
2. Hold
3. Cool

# Hardening

Very fast cooling up to quenching for non-equilibrium microstructure.

# Annealing

Slow cooling rates for fully diffused equilibrium maintaining microstructure.

## Normalizing

- Removal of uneven structures of the microstructure from casting or forging processes to a constant small uniform grain for an optimum of [[Strength]] and [[Toughness]]
- Heating should be fast to not create large grains, holding times short (but not too short) followed by a fast cooling (no quenching) 

## Spheroidizing

- Steels with perlite may be too hart to machine or plastically deform. Spheroidized steels are soft and ductile for deforming or machining.
- Heat treatment is usually at the eutecoid temperature (ca. $700Â°C$) for $15h$ up to $40 h$ and more.

## Stress Relief Annealing

- Dismantle internal stresses from previous processes (e.g. welding, machining) and heat treatments (e.g. hardening).
- Temperature range should be below a change of properties and higher than the service temperature

## Homogenizing / Diffusion Annealing

- Homogenizing of local differences in the microstructure in heterogeneous grain distributions
- Temperatures are high and the process can take up to $50 h$

## Coarse grain annealing

- Machining soft and tough metals can result in long and soft chips
- A large grain structure is created to improve the machinability 

## Tempering

- Quenched martensite is too brittle for most applications
- Tempering enhances [[Ductility]] and [[Toughness]]

# Recovery, Recrystallization, Grain Growth

 - Revert cold-worked states from plastic deformation
 - New strain-free and equiaxed grains form
 - Metal becomes softer, weaker and more ductile compared to cold-worked state
 - With increasing recrystallization temperature, tensile strength decreases and ductility increases
 - Recrystallization temperature: Temperature at that metal is fully crystallized after $1h$
