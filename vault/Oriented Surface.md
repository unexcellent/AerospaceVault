A [[Regular Surface]] is called **oriented** if it is paired with a [[Vector Field]], which assigns a unit [[Vector]] to every point on the surface.

A [[Piecewise Regular Surface]] is called **orientable** if whenever two regular component surfaces join along a common boundary curve, they induce the opposite orientations along that curve.
