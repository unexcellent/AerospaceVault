Magnetic equivalent to the [[Electrical Resistance]] in [[Magnetic Circuit|magnetic circuits]].
$$
R_{m} = \frac{\Theta}{\Phi} = \frac{l}{\mu \cdot A}
$$
-> $\Theta$: [[Magnetomotive Force]]
-> $\Phi$: [[Magnetic Flux]]
-> $l$: length of the reluctant component
-> $\mu$: [[Permeability]]
-> $A$: Cross-sectional area of the reluctant component
