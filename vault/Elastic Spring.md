Springs are elements designed to store [[Potential Energy]], that can later be released.

# Linear Spring

![[Pasted image 20231214092937.png|450]]
Stores linear [[Potential Energy]] if a [[Force]] is applied.

## Force

The behaviour of the spring is determined by the spring constant $k$:
$$
F(x) = k \cdot x
$$
-> $k$: spring constant
-> $x$: linear displacement
-> $F$: [[Force]] applied by the spring

## Potential Energy

The [[Potential Energy]] stored in the spring is defined by
$$
V_{e} = \frac{1}{2} k \cdot x^{2}
$$

## Internal Work

When a spring is compressed, [[Internal Work]] is performed along the displacement
$$
W_{i} = - F_{k} \cdot x
$$
-> $F_{k}$: Compression [[Force]]
-> $x$: Displacement

This work is called [[Strain Energy]]. It is negative, because the body acts against the deformation.

# Rotational Spring

![[Pasted image 20231214093726.png|400]]
Stores linear [[Potential Energy]] if a [[Moment]] is applied.
The behavior of the spring is determined by the spring constant $k_{\varphi}$:
$$
k_{\varphi} = -\dfrac{M_\varphi}{\varphi} = \text{const.}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow M_{\varphi}= - k_{\varphi} \cdot \varphi
$$
-> $k_\varphi$: spring constant
-> $M_\varphi$: spring [[Moment]]
-> $\varphi$: rotational displacement

## Potential Energy

The [[Potential Energy]] stored in the spring is defined by
$$
V_{e} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot k_{\varphi} \cdot \varphi^{2} 
$$
