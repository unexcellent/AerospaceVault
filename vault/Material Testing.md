Methods for determining the properties of [[Material|materials]].

# Types

## Destructive Testing

- Characterization of material properties
- Validation of component parameters in test & design phases

### Examples

- Tension, compression, bending test
- Hardness testing
- Creep testing, fatigue testing

## Non-Destructive Testing

- Quality assurance for production
- Inspection in operation

### Examples

- Ultrasonic inspection (A- / C-Scan)
- X-ray / CT-scan
- Acoustic emission

# Purposes

## Material and Process Development

- Determination of material properties (customer need base for evaluation)
- Improvement / development of materials
- Development of new manufacturing [[Material Processing|processes]]

## Concept and Design Phase

- Material properties for material selection
- Input parameters for dimensioning and analysis

## Quality Assurance

- Incoming goods control
- Production control
