A [[Primary Shaping]] method used to create cohesion from the liquid phase.

# Advantages

- Complex Geometries realizable 
- Near net-shape production possible 
- Wide Range of materials usable 
- Wide range of parts produceable: 1g â€“ several 100t 
- Economic production 
- Circular Economy

# Examples

## Casted [[Steel]]

- better high-[[Temperature]] [[Strength]] and [[Toughness]] properties compared to cast iron 
- Weldable, depending on carbon content 
- Higher manufacturing effort due to worse casting properties 
- Broad tailorability of properties due to broad variety of possible alloy elements

## Casted [[Aluminum]]

- Lower density than steel or casted iron 
- Broad variety of alloying elements allow tailorability of properties 
- [[Corrosion]] resistant 
- weldable
