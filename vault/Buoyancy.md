Symbol: $F_{B}$
Unit: $N$

Buoyancy is the [[Force]], that acts on any object submerged in a [[Fluid]] in the counter direction of [[Gravitational Potential|gravity]]. It is caused by the weight of the displaced fluid acting against the gravitational force on the object.
$$
F_{B} = \rho_{f} \cdot V \cdot g
$$
-> $\rho_{f}$: density of the [[Fluid]]
-> $V$: [[Volume]] of the object
-> $g$: gravitational acceleration

# Buoyant Mass

The buoyant [[Mass]] represents the effective mass of the object with respect to gravity.
$$
m_{b} = m_{o} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{\rho_{f}}{\rho_{o}} \right)
$$
-> $m_{0}$: [[Mass]] of the object
-> $\rho_{f}$: density of the [[Fluid]]
-> $\rho_{o}$: density of the object

The buoyant mass can be negative if $\rho_{f} > \rho_{o}$, which means that the object will move in the counter-direction to gravity.
