A heat pump is a device that supplies [[Heat]] from a source that is colder than the target using [[Thermodynamic Work]]. It is the reverse of the [[Carnot Cycle]].

# Efficiency

The [[Thermal Efficiency]] of a heat pump is characterized by the coefficient of performance $\beta'$.
$$
\beta' = \frac{Q_{out}}{W_{in}} = \frac{T_{H}}{T_{H} - T_{C}}
$$
-> $Q_{out}$: supplied [[Heat]]
-> $W_{in}$: Energy cost
-> $T_{H}$: [[Temperature]] of the target
-> $T_{C}$: [[Temperature]] of the source
