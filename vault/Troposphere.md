The troposphere is a layer in [[Earth's Atmosphere]] around $\pu{16-18 km}$ from the surface at the equator and $\pu{8-10 km}$ from the surface at the poles.

# Processes

## Surface Heating

Warm (less dense) air rises up in the atmosphere.

## Adiabatic Cooling

Air cools down when expanding in an [[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]] cooling process.
The adiabatic lapse rate can be calculated via
$$
\Gamma = \frac{g}{c_{p}}
$$
-> $g$: gravitational acceleration
-> $c_{p}$: [[Heat Capacity]]
