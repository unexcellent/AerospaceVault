Moments occur if a system does not have a [[Force#Central Force Groups|central group of forces]].

This results in rotation.

If a force $\overrightarrow{F}$ is generated with respect to a point $A$:
![[Moments 2023-10-19 09.14.01.excalidraw]]

Then the moment is defined by in 2D:
$$
M_{A}= F \cdot a, \quad [M_{A}] = Nm
$$
In 3D spatial structures it is defined by the [[Cross-Product of Vectors|cross product]] of force and location [[Vector|vector]]:

$$
\overrightarrow{M} = \overrightarrow{F} \times \overrightarrow{r}_{0P}
$$

# Force Pairs

Moments can be defined as force pairs with:
- same magnitude
- opposite directions
- on parallel lines of action

There is no force applied to the object, only a moment.

The resulting moment can be calculated as follows for any point:
$$
M = a \cdot F
$$

# Moment as a Vector

Since a moment can be expressed by $M = a \cdot F$, it can be written as
$$
\overrightarrow{M} = r_{0P} \times \overrightarrow{F}, \quad |\overrightarrow{M}| = M
$$

with $r_{0P}$ being the vector from the coordinate system origin to the point.

The moment vector points in the direction in which a right-hand screw moves with the same direction of rotation.
