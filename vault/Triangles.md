Triangles are [[Polygons]] with 3 interior angles.

# Comparing Triangles

## Congruence

Two triangles are called **congruent**, if their sides have the same length and the interior angles have the same measures
-> They might be rotated or reflected differently

### Criteria

- Two pairs of sides of sides are equal in length and the inclosed angles are equal in measure (SAS)
- Three pairs of sides are equal in length (SSS)
- Two pairs of angles are equal in measure and the included sides are equal in length (ASA)
- Two pairs of angels are equal in measure and a pair of non-included sides are equal (AAS)

## Similarity

Two triangles are called **similar**, if their interior angles have the same measure.
-> They might be rotated, reflected or scaled differently

### Criteria

- Three pairs of angles (AAA)
