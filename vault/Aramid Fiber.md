Organic artificial [[Reinforcing Fiber]], consist of macro polymeric chains. Manufactured via wet spinning process from liquid medium.

# Advantages

- High stiffness 
- High tensile strength 
- Low density (1.45 g/cm3) 
- Better impact resistance (3.5% failure strain) 
- Non-conductive 
- Good resistance to organic solvents

# Disadvantages

- Lower compressive strength 
- Moisture absorption 
- Difficult handling (e.g. cutting)
