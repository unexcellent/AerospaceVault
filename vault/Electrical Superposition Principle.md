Method of solving [[Electric Circuit|electric circuits]] with multiple [[Electrical Energy Source]].

Given a circuit with multiple voltage sources $V_{1}, V_{2}, \dots, V_{n}$, the [[Voltage]] at any given point $P$ can be determined via:
$$
V_{P} = \sum^{n}_{k=1} V_{Pk}
$$
with $V_{Pk}$ denoting the voltage at point $P$ if all voltage sources except $V_{k}$ are ignored.

The same principle holds for current sources.
