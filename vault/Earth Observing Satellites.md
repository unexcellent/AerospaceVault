# Geodetic Observing Systems

Geometry and kinematics:
- point position
- deformations
- [[Ocean|sea]] surface
Rotation and Orientation
- angular velocity
- orientation of rotation axis
Gravity field
- angular velocity
- orientation and rotation axis

# Geometry and Kinematics

## Tracking Techniques

Responsible for 3D-positions and their changes of ground stations
- **GNSS**: Global Navigation Satellite System passive (1-way) method; signal coming from GNSS satellites
- **SLR/LLR**: Satellite Laser Ranging / Lunar Laser Ranging active (2-way) method; actively sent signal from ground station is reflected from satellite/moon

## Altimetry

Height and height changes of [[Ocean]] surface or [[Cryosphere|ice]] sheets
- **Radar and laser:**  altimetry active (2-way) method; microwave or laser signal is emitted from satellite, and reflected back from the ocean/ice surface.

## Remote Sensing

Mapping of Earth surface and its changes.
- **InSAR**: Interferometric satellite aperture radar active (2-way) method; radar signals are emitted from satellite and reflected back from Earth surface. Interferometric processing of intensity and phase.
