#uni/courses/materials 

A subgroup of [[Ferrous Metal]] mainly containing iron and between $0.008$ to $2.14$ wt% carbon.

# Low-Carbon Steel

Steels with less than about $0.25$ wt% carbon. 
- No influence of martensite from [[Heat Treatment|heat treatments]]
- Microstructure is ferrite and pearlite
- [[Strengthening Mechanism|Strengthening]] is performed by cold work
- Low [[Strength]] and low [[Hardness]], high [[Ductility]] and [[Toughness]]
- Machinable and weldable
- Low price

# Medium-Carbon Steel

Steels with wt% carbon content between $0.25$ and $0.6$
- Mostly [[Heat Treatment|heat treated]] to improve mechanical properties
- Addition of alloys improve mechanical properties
- [[Strength|Stronger]] than low-carbon steels, but lower [[Ductility]] and [[Toughness]]
- Utilized in high-strength and toughness applications (railway-wheels, gears, crankshafts)

# High-Carbon Steel

Steels with wt% carbon content between $0.6$ and $1.4$
- [[Hardness|Hardest]] and [[Strength|strongest]], least [[Ductility|ductile]] steels
- Often used as tool steels with alloying elements chromium, vanadium, tungsten, and molybdenum

# Stainless Steel

- Resistant to corrosion (rusting) in a variety of environments
- Chromium with at least $11$ wt% is required
- Corrosion enhancement with [[Nickel]] and molybdenum is possible
- Austenitic are most corrosion resistant
- Ferrite and Austenite are not heat treatable, but with cold work
- Martensite and ferrite are magnetic, austenitic not
- High temperature resistance, low creep
