#uni/courses/materials 

Category of [[Material|materials]] whose molecules are arranged in a highly ordered structure. Includes of [[Metalic Material|metals]] and [[Ceramic Material|ceramics]].

- Properties of crystalline solids depend on the crystal structure of the material
- Lattice = crystal structures
- When describing crystal structures, it is often convenient to subdivide the structure into small repeat entities called unit cells

# Single Crystal

- Perfect periodic and repeated arrangement of atoms throughout the entire specimen/part
- All unit cells interlock in the same way and have the same orientation
- Exist in nature or can be artificially produced

# Poly-Crystal

- Collection of many small crystals or grains with different crystallographic orientations
- A grain boundary is separating two grains with atomic mismatch
- Most materials are polycrystalline

# Directional Properties

A crystalline material is called **isotropic**, if the physical properties are independent of direction.

A crystalline material is called **anisotropic**, if the physical properties are dependent of direction.
