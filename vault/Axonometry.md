- is used for the spatial representation of components
- is a graphical procedure that generates a planar image of a three-dimensional object

# Representations

## Isometric

- the three spatial axes (x, y, z) have identical side ratios. (Greek: isometric ~ equal)
- Used for representations in which essential features are to be shown clearly in all three views.
- Angles of the spatial axes to the horizontal in the [[Technical Drawings|drawing]] plane: x = 30°, y = 30°, z = 90 °
- Side ratio: x : y : z = 1 : 1 : 1

## Dimetric Representation

- Two of the three spatial axes (y, z) have identical side ratios. (Greek: dimetric ~ two-size, roughly meaning “two-axis measurement”)
- Used for representations in which essential features are to be shown clearly in the main view (here the plane y-z).
- Angles of the spatial axes to the horizontal in the drawing plane: x = 42°, y = 7°, z = 90°
- Side ratio: x : y : z = 0.5 : 1 : 1

# Views

- to show all information of the component in the technical drawing

The faces can be indicated by the arrow method if they are not immediately clear:

## Partial Views

Can hide uninteresting or trivial parts of the object:

Or they can be used in symmetrical components.

Partial views should be shown in projection method 3 regardless of the projection rule of the remainder of the drawing.

# Projections

## Method 1

Used in Europe
![[Pasted image 20231025104757.png]]

- Projection method 1, First Angle Projection Method (used in Europe): The basic idea of the first-angle projection method can be simply described as, the viewer looking at the 3-D object and projects the view on a plane behind the object.

## Method 3

Used in USA, GB

- Projection method 3, Third Angle Projection Method (used in GB and USA): The basic idea of the third-angle projection method can be simply described as, the viewer looking at the 3-D object and projects the view on a plane in front of the object.

# Details

- An area of the view is enlarged and illustrated clearly.
- Marking: Rectangular or circular frame with narrow, full lines (window) and labelled with a capital letter (X, Y, Z)
- The marked detail is illustrated in the enlarged scale (e.g. Z 5:1), the scale used must be specified.
- The detail illustrated may be drawn without a boundary line or surrounding edges, and in the case of sections also without hatching.
