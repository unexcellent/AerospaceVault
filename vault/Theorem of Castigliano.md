Method for calculating the [[Displacement in Bars|displacement]] of a system due to multiple [[Force|forces]].
$$
f_{i} = \frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial F_{i}}
$$
-> $f_{i}$: Displacement of in the direction of $F_{i}$
-> $\Pi$: Total [[Strain Energy]] of the system. Can be calculated via [[Betti's Theorem]]
-> $F_{i}$: [[Force]] causing the displacement $i$
