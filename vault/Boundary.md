Symbol: $\partial A$

The boundary of an [[Area]] $A$ is the [[Set]] of all points $x_{0}$ with an [[Open Ball]] $B_\delta(x_{0})$ where $B_\delta(x_{0})$ partially lies within $A$ and outside of $A$.
$$
\exists \delta > 0: \quad B_{\delta}(x_{0}) \ \cap \ A \neq \emptyset \ \ \text{and}
 \ \ B_{\delta}(x_{0}) \ \cap \ A^{c} \neq \emptyset
$$

The points contained in $\partial A$ are called **boundary points**.
