Symbol: $\tau$

Rotational equivalent of [[Stress]].

# For a Cylinder

$$
\tau = G \cdot \gamma = \frac{M_{T}(x)}{I_{T}} \cdot r
$$
-> $G$: [[Shear Modulus]]
-> $\gamma$: [[Rotational Strain]]
-> $M_{T}$: [[Torsional Moment]]
-> $x$: distance to the fix point of the cylinder along the rotation axis
-> $I_{T}$: [[Torsional Moment of Inertia]]
-> $r$: radius of the cylinder
