Ideal gas is an idealized model of a real [[States of Matter#Gas|gas]]. For ideal gases, all gases show the same behaviour. 
It is assumed, that the gas particles have no [[Volume]], all their energy is kinetic energy and all collisions are fully elastic.

For relatively low [[Pressure|pressures]] ideal gases show a good approximation to real gases.
