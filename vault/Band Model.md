The [[Electron|electrons]] in [[Atom|atoms]] are located inside orbits, which have a certain energy level depending on their distance from the nucleus. To change between orbits, a certain amount of energy $\Delta W$ is needed.

For adjacent atoms, interactions cause the energy states to split.
Since there are many such states in solids, they are grouped into so-called energy bands. The gaps between the energy bands are called band gaps.

Only electrons in the conduction band are able to conduct.
The higher the temperature, the more free electrons exist. The density of free electrons is called the intrinsic conduction carrier density.
A disbanded electron pair binding leaves one electron and one hole each (“generation”). Free electrons can also fill up a hole again (“recombination”).
At any given temperature, this creates a thermodynamic equilibrium of generation and recombination.

The conductivity of a [[Material|material]] depends on the number of electrons in the conduction band. The smaller the band gap, the easier it is for electrons to enter the conduction band. Materials with small band gaps conduct very well (e.g. [[Metalic Material|metals]]), materials with a large band gap do not. In between are the [[Semiconductor]] materials.
