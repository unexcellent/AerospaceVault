# Anomalies

Anomalies describe [[Mass]] concentrations in [[Earth's Mantle]], that do not conform to standard models.

There are two effects contributing to the gravitational signal of a mass anomaly in the Earthâ€˜s mantle: 
- The gravitational signal of the mass itself 
- The dynamic topography caused by the flow generated by the mass anomaly
