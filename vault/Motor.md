If a coil carrying current in a [[Magnetic Field]], a force acts upon it, which causes the coil to rotate.

$$
F(t) = N \cdot i(t) \cdot l \cdot B
$$
-> $F$: [[Force]]
-> $N$: Number of turns in the coil
-> $i$: [[Current]]
-> $l$: length of the coil
-> $B$: [[Magnetic Flux Density]]

To achieve the greatest possible force development with a multiple coil arrangement, it is recommended to arrange the current directions in the coil sides as shown below

# Torque

$$
T_{e,coil}(t) = F_{t}(t) \cdot d = \frac{v_{i,coil}(t) \cdot i(t)}{\omega_{m}}
$$
-> T: [[Torque]]
-> d: diameter of the coil
