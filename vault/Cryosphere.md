The cryosphere is all the surface on [[Earth]], that is covered in ice, which in total covers ca. $\pu{10.9\%}$.

# Ice Mass Balance

## Budget Method

- measurement of all input & output quantities
- similar to hydrological models
![[Pasted image 20240826081341.png|300]]
- Problem: determination of individual components with large uncertainties

## Geometric Metric

- observation of geometric (surface) changes (ice altimetry, SAR)
![[Pasted image 20240826081411.png|300]]
- Problem: computation of mass changes requires the assumption of mass density

## Gravimetric Method

- direct observation of mass changes by gravity field missions (GRACE)
![[Pasted image 20240826081505.png|300]]
- Problem: spatial and temporal resolution; separation from other mass signals
