Symbol: $\eta_{th}$
Unit: $1$

Thermal efficiency is the ratio between the useful energy output and the supplied energy.
$$
\eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{|Q_\text{out}|}{Q_\text{in}}
$$
-> $Q$: [[Heat]]

# Perfect Thermal Efficiency

In theory 100% efficiency is possible if a process has no [[Friction]] and is infinitely slow, but the [[Thermodynamic Work]] output is limited.
