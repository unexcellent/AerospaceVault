Similar to [[Earth's Atmosphere]] [[Earth's Mantle]] experiences convection currents caused by [[Temperature]] gradients at different depths.
[[Heat]] is supplied by [[Earth's Core]], which leads to a decrease of density in bottom layers. This rising magma causes cooler magma from closer to the surface to sink down to the core creating convection cycles.

According to an experiment by Rayleigh-Benard convection occurs in the mantle if the [[Rayleigh Number]] $R_{a} > 658$

# Patterns

Horizontal rolls of rising, hotter [[Fluid]] (dark lines) and sinking colder fluid (light lines)

The bimodal pattern has a primary set of horizontal rolls with a weaker perpendicular set of rolls

# Behavior

The mantle has a [[Reynolds Number]] of $10^{-19} < R_{e} < 10^{-21}$. The flow is therefore laminar.

The mantle has a [[Peclet Number]] of $P_{et} \approx 100$. Advection therefore dominates.

The mantle has a [[Prandtl Number]] of $P_{r} \approx 10^{24}$. This means that viscous response to any perturbation is much faster than the thermal response.
