- [[Composite Material|Composite structures]] are widely used in Aerospace due to the low weight and the high strength and stiffness of the structural parts.
- The manufacturing of composite parts does, in most cases, require the use of moulds:
	- Derive negative mould shape from positive [[Computer Aided Design|CAD]] part
	- Adapt the mould design to the specific needs of the manufacturing process
	- Transfer the design features to the machining process
	- Manufacturing process of composite parts
- Example:
	- Wing design and manufacturing for a cargo UAV (@AkaModell)
