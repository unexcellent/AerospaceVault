The Brayton cycle (or Joule cycle) is the cycle, that turbines are generally based on.

# General Cycle

- **1 → 2**: [[Adiabatic Process|Adiabatic]] Compression 
- **2 → 3**: [[Isochoric Process|Isochoric]] [[Heat Conduction|heat transfer]] in 
- **3 → 4**: [[Adiabatic Process|Adiabatic]] Expansion 
- **4 → 1**: [[Isochoric Process|Isochoric]] [[Heat Conduction|heat transfer]] out

# Open Brayton Cycle

Hot working [[Fluid]] is ejected and fresh cool working fluid is taken in (e.g. aircraft engines).

# Closed Brayton Cycle

Working [[Fluid]] exchanges [[Heat]] in cooler (e.g. power plant gas turbines).

# Efficiency

The maximum [[Thermal Efficiency]] is
$$
\eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}} 
= 1 - \frac{1}{\left( \frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}} \right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
$$
-> $T$: [[Temperature]]
-> $p$: [[Pressure]]
-> $\gamma$: [[Isentropic Exponent]]

Therefore higher compressor pressure ratio $PR = \frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}$ yields higher thermal efficiency as well as to a higher temperature at turbine entry $T_{3}$
