A point $x_{0}$ is called an accumulation point of an [[Area]] $A$ if there exists a [[Sequence of Numbers|sequence]] $(x_{k}) \subseteq A$ with $x_{k} \in A \\ \{ x_{0} \}$ such that
$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} x_{k} = x_{0}
$$

Every [[Interior Point]] of $A$ is an accumulation point and no [[Exterior Point]] of $A$ is an accumulation point.
