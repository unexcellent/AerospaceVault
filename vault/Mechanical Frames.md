- [[Mechanical Beams|beam]] structures with kinks and/or bifurcations
- [[Static Determinacy|statically determinate]] frames can be subdivided into beam sections and calculated according to the previous section
- transition conditions must be considered at kinks and bifurcations

Frames can be solved by [[Cutting Principle (Free Body Diagram)|cutting]] them into their individual beams and assigning individual coordinate systems to them.
