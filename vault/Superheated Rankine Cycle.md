A superheater can be added to a [[Rankine Cycle]], which increases [[Thermal Efficiency]].

 The cycle is then
 - **1 → 2**: [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] compression of a [[States of Matter#Liquid|liquid]] in a pump 
 - **2 → 4’**: [[Isobaric Process|Isobaric]] [[Heat]] addition in a boiler, [[Vaporization]] and superheating 
 - **4’ → 5’**: [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] expansion in a turbine, state 5’ in the two-phase region 0 < 𝑥5′ < 1 
 - **5’ → 1**: [[Isobaric Process|Isobaric]] [[Heat]] rejection in a condenser
