The Nusselt number describes the importance of convection to the heat transport. It is the ratio between heat transported by the convective flow to the heat that would be transported by conduction alone.
$$
N_{u} = \frac{Q \cdot d}{k \cdot \Delta T}
$$
-> $Q$: [[Heat]]
-> $d$: distance
-> $k$: ???
-> $\Delta T$: [[Temperature]] gradientl
