Synonym: Theorem of the minimum of internal
work

Method for solving [[Static Determinacy|statically indeterminate]] systems.

In the quasi-static, isothermal loading of an elastic body, the statically indeterminate reactions $X_{k}$ arise so that the [[Strain Energy]] $\Pi(F_{i}, X_{k})$ becomes a minimum:
$$
\frac{\partial \Pi(F_{i}, X_{k})}{\partial X_{k}} = 0
$$
