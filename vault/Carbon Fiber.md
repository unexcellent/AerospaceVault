[[Reinforcing Fiber]] made from carbon-based precursors on large scale that are converted by pyrolysis into specific carbon structure with high tensile [[Strength]].

# Properties

- Low density ($1.7 â€“ 1.9 \frac{g}{cm^{3}}$) 
- Negative [[Thermal Expansion]]
- Anisotropic (axial vs transversal) 
- High [[Modulus of Elasticity|modulus]] and [[Strength]] 
- Excellent [[Creep Testing|creep resistance]] 
- High cost 
- Low strain to failure ([[Toughness|brittle]])
