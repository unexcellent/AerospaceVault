Solar radiation [[Electromagnetic Radiation]] originating from the [[Sun]].

The sun emits $P = \pu{3.87 \cdot 10^{26} W}$ of solar radiation. A total of $P_{E} = \pu{1.75 \cdot 10^{17} W}$ hits the [[Earth]].

This radiation does not act on earth equally.

# Spectrum

The temperature of the solar spectrum is $\approx \pu{5800 K}$, which is close to a [[Black Body]]. However, not all wavelengths reach the surface in equal proportions.

# Reflection

The earth must emit the same amount of energy as it receives from the sun, otherwise it would heat up and kill all life on the planet.
The radiation from earth is mostly in the infrared spectrum
