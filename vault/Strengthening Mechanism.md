- The most important mechanical property of the [[Material]] is its [[Strength]]: (1) yield point and (2) tensile strength are of interest
- Yield point is determined by the onset of dislocation movements, restricting or hindering dislocation motion renders a material [[Hardness|harder]] and [[Strength|stronger]]

# Solid Solution Strengthening

- Foreign [[Atom|atoms]] are dissolved in a [[Crystalline Material]] as substitutional or interstitial atoms
- These foreign atoms hinder the mobility of dislocations by distorting the lattice
- Variation with [[Nickel]] content in [[Copper]]-[[Nickel]] alloys, showing strengthening:

# Strengthening by Grain Size Reduction

- Grain refinement: achieving large number of grain boundaries by using as many small grains as possible
- Grain boundaries hinder the migration of dislocations for two reasons:
	- When two grains are of different orientations, a dislocation passing into grain B from grain A will have to change its direction of motion
	- The atomic disorder within a grain boundary region results in a discontinuity of slip planes from one grain into the other

# Strain Hardening

- The phenomenon where a ductile metal becomes harder and stronger as it is [[Deformation Mechanism#Plastic Deformation|plastically deformed]]
- Plastic deformation must occur at a [[Temperature]] low enough that atoms cannot rearrange themselves
- Cold working process: dislocation multiplication or the formation of new dislocations -> dislocations interact and become pinned or tangled -> decrease in the mobility of the dislocations -> strengthening of the material
