Symbol: $I$

The electrical current is the charge transport per time unit.
$$
I = \frac{Q}{t}= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$
$$
i(t) = \frac{dQ(t)}{dt}
$$

The current is defined from the positive potential to the negative potential (against the physical flow of electrons).

# Unit

Ampere $[A]$
$$
1 A = C \cdot s^{-1}
$$

# Flow Types

Electron Flow:
- In metals
- In semiconductors
- In ionized gases
- In vacuum

Ion flow:
- Associated with material transport
- Leads to structural changes

# In an [[AC Circuit]]

When the current is alternating in a sinus pattern, it can be expressed as a time varying quantity
$$
i(t) = \hat{I} \cdot \sin(\omega t + \varphi_{I})
$$
-> $\hat{I}$: current amplitude
-> $\omega$: angular velocity
-> $t$: time
-> $\varphi_{I}$: phase shift

## Effective Current

The effective current is a measure of the amount of current that can actually perform work
$$
I_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{\hat{I}}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

## Complex Form

$$
\underline{I} = I_\text{RMS} \cdot e^{j \varphi_{I}}
$$
