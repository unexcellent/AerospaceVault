$$
\Phi_{loop}(t) = B \cdot l \cdot d \cdot \cos \alpha(t)
$$
-> $\Phi$: [[Magnetic Flux]]
-> $B$: [[Magnetic Flux Density]]
-> $l$: length of the loop
-> $d$: diameter of the loop
-> $\alpha$: angle of the loop

$$
\Psi_{coil}(t) = N \cdot \Phi_{loop}(t)
$$
-> $\Psi$: [[Flux Linkage]]
-> $N$: Number of turns in the coil
-> $\Phi$: [[Magnetic Flux]]

## Amplitude

$$
\hat{\Psi} = B \cdot l \cdot d
$$

# Induced Voltage

When the coil rotates with the constant mechanical angular frequency
$$
\omega_{m} = \alpha'(t) = \text{const.}
$$
then a [[Voltage]] is induced in the coil
$$
v_{i,coil}(t) = - \hat{\Psi}_{coil}(t) \cdot \omega_{m} \cdot \sin \alpha(t)
$$

## Amplitude

$$
\hat{V}_{i,coil} = \omega_{m} \cdot \hat{\Psi}_{coil}
$$
