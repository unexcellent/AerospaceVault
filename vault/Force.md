A single force is uniquely defined by
- its magnitude (amount)
- its direction (line of action)
- its point of application

# Unit

The unit of force is Newton: $N = \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}$

# Vector Representation

- amount and direction are defined as a [[Vector|vector]]
- vector can be displayed as components

- magnitude of a force can be calculated by the [[Vector#Norm of a Vector (Length)|norm of the vector]]

# Newtonian Axioms

## Equilibrium Axiom

The vector sum of the forces of an equilibrium group results in 0.
$$
\overrightarrow{F} + (-\overrightarrow{F}) = 0
$$
## Axiom of Line Volatility

Forces can be shifted along the line of action

## Axiom of Interaction

A forces always generates an equal and opposite counter-force.

## Axiom of Parallelogram of forces

![[Pasted image 20231019121214.png]]

Force vectors can be added to a result vector $\overrightarrow{R}$.

# Central Force Groups

If forces intersect in a central point, they are called a central force group.

The forces can be added together by applying the [[Force#Axiom of Line Volatility|axiom of line volatility]]

The resulting force can be calculated as following:
$$
\overrightarrow{R} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \overrightarrow{F_{i}}
$$
The central force groups usually result in a force equilibrium if $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \overrightarrow{F_{i}} = 0$.

# Parallel Displacement of a Force

A force can be displaced parallel to its direction if the [[Moment|moment]], that it would have generated is considered in the result:
