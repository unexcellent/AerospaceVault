Let $\Pi^{n}[a,b]$ be the [[Vector Space]] of [[Polynomial and Rational Functions|polynomials]] of degree $\le n$ for $x \in [a,b]$.

$(p_{j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}_{0}}$ is a sequence of orthogonal polynomials, where $j$ represents the degree of the polynomial, if $\langle p_{k}, p_{l} \rangle = 0$ $\forall k,l \in \mathbb{N}_{0}, k \neq l$.

In the special case, where $p_{0} = 1$, it is called a Legendre polynomial.
