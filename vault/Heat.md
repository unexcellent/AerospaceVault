Symbol: $Q$
Unit: $J$

Heat is the part of the energy, that is absorbed or released by a [[Thermodynamic System]]. It is transported due to [[Temperature]] differences.
$$
Q = C \cdot \Delta T
$$
-> $C$: [[Heat Capacity]]
-> $\Delta T$: [[Temperature]] change

Heat transfer can alter the system’s [[States of Matter|state]], e.g. melting ice to water.

Objects don’t "contain" heat – heat is energy, that is transferred across system boundaries.

The amount of heat needed for a state change is [[Process Path|path]] dependent.
