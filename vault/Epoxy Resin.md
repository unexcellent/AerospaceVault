Part of the [[Thermoset]]-group.

- Formed from chain-shaped un-cross-linked epoxy resins by addition [[Polymer Synthesis#Polymerization|polymerization]]
- High-quality materials with particularly good mechanical and thermal properties
- In combination with inorganic reinforcing fibres, very high [[Strength]] and [[Stiffness]] can be achieved

# Properties

- Broadly influenceable 
- Thermal application limits between 130 and 240 Â°C 
- Transparent & can be colored as desired 
- Very good [[Electrical Conductivity|electrical insulating]] properties 
- Good weather resistance 
- Resistant to the influence of water, diluted acid, fuels, alcohols and oils 
- Depending on composition also good resistance to flammability 
- Good dimensional stability of the molded parts due to low shrinkage

# Application

- Paints & coatings 
- Construction & flooring 
- Automotive 
- Electronics 
- Sports & leisure 
- Aerospace
