The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined as amount of [[Heat]] that needs to be transferred to change the [[Temperature]] by 1 Kelvin, or in its specific form, for 1 Kelvin and 1 kilogram.

# Heat Capacity at Constant Volume

The [[Isochoric Process|isochoric]] [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] heat capacity is defined as
$$
c_{v}(T) = \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial T} \right)_{p} = \left( \frac{\partial q}{\partial T} \right)_{p}
$$
-> $T$: [[Temperature]]
-> $u$: [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Internal Energy]]
-> $q$: [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Heat]]

For small temperature changes, $c_{v}$ is assumed to be constant.

# Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure

The [[Isobaric Process|isobaric]] [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] heat capacity is defined as
$$
c_{p}(T) = \left( \frac{\partial q}{\partial T} \right)_{p} = \left( \frac{\partial h}{\partial T} \right)_{p}
$$
-> $T$: [[Temperature]]
-> $q$: [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Heat]]
-> $h$: [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Enthalpy]]

For small temperature changes, $c_{p}$ is assumed to be constant.
