Symbol: $T_{t}$
Unit: $K$

When the flow of a [[Fluid]] reaches a [[Stagnation Point]], the [[Temperature]] of the [[Fluid]] changes.
$$
T_{t} = T_{1} + \frac{c_{1}^{2}}{2 \cdot c_{p}} = T_{1} + T_{1} \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M^{2}
$$
-> $T_{1}$: [[Temperature]] of the fluid during motion
-> $c_{1}$: velocity of the fluid before the stagnation point
-> $c_{p}$: [[Thermodynamic State#Specific Property|specific]] [[Heat Capacity#Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure|isobaric heat capacity]] of the fluid
-> $M$: [[Mach Number]]
