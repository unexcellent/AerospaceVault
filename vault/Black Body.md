A black body is an idealized body, which absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation. It emits the absorbed energy completely. 
This radiation depends only on the effective absolute [[Temperature]] of the body.
$$
F(T) = \sigma \cdot T_{eff}^{4}
$$
-> $F$: [[Effective Heat Flux]]
-> $T_{eff}$: effective [[Temperature]]
-> $\sigma$: [[Stefan-Boltzmann Constant]]
