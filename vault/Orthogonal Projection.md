Method of finding the [[Vector Space#Orthogonality|orthogonal projection of a vector space]].

Given an $m$-dimensional vector space $W$, the orthogonal projection of a [[Vector|vector]] $x$ on $W$ is called $P(x) \in W$

If we fix a [[Basis of a Vector Space|basis]] for $(v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{m}) \subset W$, then
$$
P(x) = \sum^{m}_{i=1} \langle v_{i}, x \rangle \cdot v_{i}
$$
