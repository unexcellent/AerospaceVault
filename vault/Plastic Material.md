#uni/courses/materials 

A class of [[Material]] consisting of ca. known 15,000 members.

Plastics are materials whose essential components consist of such macromolecular organic compounds that are formed synthetically or by transformation of natural products.

# Properties

Plastics have a wide, adjustable spectrum of mechanical properties and usually have high chemical resistance.

# Degradation

## Thermal Oxidation

- Thermal oxidation is the degradation of a polymeric material through contact with a chemical oxidizer 
- It depends upon oxygen, Temperature and structure of polymers 
- Oxidation leads to molecular weight reduction through shortening of the polymer chains 
- Residual byproducts or formulation additives (free radicals) react with oxygen to attack the polymer backbone covalent bonds.

## Chain Scission

- Chain scission: degradation without chemical agent (e.g. Oxygen) 
- The molecular structure of the polymer is altered solely based on energy (such high levels of stress or temperature) 
- Rapid decreases in molecular weight due to broke backbone chains (unsaturation) 
- Chain scission is caused by exposure to elevated temperatures in combination with high shear stress

## Hydrolysis

- Hydrolysis is the degradation of a polymeric material through contact with water (hydrogen cations (H+) or hydroxyl anions (OH-)) 
- The hydrolysis mechanism proceeds through the reaction of the polymer with water 
- Cleavage of the susceptible functional group 
- Water absorption can significantly alter the mechanical properties of a plastic 
- Most hydrolysis-resistant plastics: 
	- Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) 
	- Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) â€¢ Polybenzimidazole (PBI) 
	- Polyetherimide (PEI) 
	- Polysulfone (PSU) 
- Highly water degradable: Polylactide (PLA)
