If the [[Thermodynamic State|state]] of a [[Thermodynamic System|system]] changes, then the system is undergoing a **process**.

If the system returns to its initial state, the process is a so called cyclic process or cycle.

# Reversible Process

A process which is the same in both directions. No energy is lost. The [[Entropy]] change of that process is zero.

# Irreversible Process

A process which can only be performed in one direction. Energy is lost and is required to reverse the process.

The [[Entropy]] change of that process is larger than zero.
