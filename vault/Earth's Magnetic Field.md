The [[Earth]] generates its own [[Magnetic Field]], where the poles roughly match with the rotation axis.

It approximates a ferromagnet close to the surface, but looks more complex from higher altitudes.

# Origin

Earth's magnetic field most likely originates from spiralling columns of molten [[Ferrous Metal|iron]] in [[Earth's Core]].

# Magnetic Anomalies

Magnetic anomalies occur due to differing concentrations of iron in different parts of [[Earth's Crust]]. These can be attributed to [[Plate Tectonics]].
