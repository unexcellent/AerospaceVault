A surface $\Sigma$ is called piecewise regular if it is composed of a finite number of regular surfaces $\Sigma_{1}, \dots, \Sigma_{m}$ joined pairwise along their edges.

It is denoted by $\Sigma = \Sigma_{1} + \dots + \Sigma_{m}$

# Surface Integral

The [[Surface Integral]] over a piecewise regular surface is given by
$$
\int_{\Sigma} f \ dS = \int_{\Sigma_{1}} f \ dS + \dots + \int_{\Sigma_{m}} f \ dS
$$
