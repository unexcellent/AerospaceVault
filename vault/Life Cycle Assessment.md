Life cycle assessment is a technique for assessing the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with a [[Material]].

Assessment from raw resource extraction to end of life.

# Goals

## Product System Definition

- Mapping of the process steps and their interactions in a system flow chart. 
- Definition of byproducts 
- Mapping of the material and energy flows 
- Detailed definition of the process steps (relevant processing parameters)

## Functional Unit

- Reference value of the product system 
- All inputs and outputs are referred to the functional unit

## System Boundaries

- Defines which process steps are included in the LCA 
- Includes geographical boundary and date/period

# Life Cycle Inventory

Database of life cycle information of materials.

## Handling Data Gaps

### Option 1

Estimate data values and then check relevance through sensitivity analysis. 

### Option 2

Neglecting the respective input / output flow based on cutoff criteria, if.. 
- Material flow < x% of total mass and/or 
- Energy flow < x% of total energy and/or 
- Fraction of environmental impact < x% of total total environmental impact

-> Cut-off criteria (x%) must be defined precisely and must be published transparently

# Life Cycle Impact Assessment

Quantifies environmental consequences of the product by aggregating & translating inventory into impact.
