Symbol: $R_{e}$
Unit: $1$

The Reynolds number describes the flow regime of [[Fluid|fluids]]. It is the ratio between [[Inertia]] and viscous drag.
$$
R_{e} = \frac{\rho \cdot d \cdot u}{\eta}
$$
-> $\rho$: density
-> $d$: ???
-> $u$: ???
-> $\eta$: [[Viscosity]]

For $R_{e} \ll 1$ the flow is laminar since viscous [[Force|forces]] dominate. For $R_{e} \gg 1$ the flow will be turbulent.
