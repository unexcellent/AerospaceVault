Bending of light rays when passing from one medium to another.

Caused by the changes in velocity of the light in different [[Material|materials]].

$$
n_{1} \cdot \sin \theta_{1} = n_{2} \cdot \sin \theta_{2}
$$
-> $n_{1}$: incident [[Index of Refraction]]
-> $\theta_{1}$: incident angle
-> $n_{2}$ refracted [[Index of Refraction]]
-> $\theta_{2}$: refracted angle
