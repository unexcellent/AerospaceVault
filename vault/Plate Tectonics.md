Plate tectonics is the science of the movement of the plates in [[Earth's Crust]].

The movement can be generalized as
$$
\underline{x}(t) = \underline{x}_{0} + \underline{v}_{0}(t-t_{0}) + \sum_{j} \Delta \underline{x}_{j} (t)
$$
-> $t$: time
-> $t_{0}$: epoch
-> $\underline{x}$: position of a plate
-> $\underline{x}_{0}$: position at epoch
-> $\underline{v}_{0}$: station velocity at epoch
-> $\Delta \underline{x}_{j}$: corrections (tides, loading, GIA)

# Origin

The outermost layer (lithosphere) is divided into a small number of "rigid" plates that move relative to each other on a weak layer that is called asthenosphere
- The asthenosphere [[Viscosity]] is low enough to allow for viscous flow on long time scales of Ma
- The generation of new plate material occurs by sea floor spreading
- The new oceanic lithosphere forms part of a rigid plate that may or may not include continental material
- Continents and [[Ocean|Oceans]] behave differently due to their different density
- Earthâ€™s surface area remains constant; this means that seafloor spreading must be balanced by consumption (subduction) of plates elsewhere
- Lithospheric plates are capable of transmitting [[Stress]] over great horizontal scale. In other words plates are rigid and the deformation is concentrated along the boundaries.
