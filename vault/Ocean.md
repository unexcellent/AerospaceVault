The ocean is the body of salt water, that covers around $\pu{70\%}$ of [[Earth|Earth's]] surface.

# Climate Properties

- High [[Heat Capacity]] 
	- slow heating/cooling 
	- "moderator" of climate system
- Liquid 
	- Heat transport by convection 
	- Mixing by wind and tides (surface)
- High amount of [[Vaporization|evaporation]] 
	- Phase transition 
	- "moderator" of climate system 
- Wind intensifies evaporation and transports latent heat over large distances

# Physical Oceanography


- Dynamics: [[States of Matter#Liquid|liquid]] layer on rotating sphere (like [[Earth's Atmosphere|Atmosphere]]) 
- Application of hydrodynamic equations (Navier-Stokes) 
- Most important physical parameters: 
	- [[Temperature]] 
	- [[Pressure]] 
	- salinity 
- Differences from atmosphere 
	- density (factor 1000): atmosphere moves much faster 
	- high [[Heat Capacity]] 
	- lengths and time-scales

# Layers

- **Mixed layer (a few meters)** 
	- warm surface water 
	- Mixing by wind and waves (Ekman)  wind-driven circulation 
	- transparent in thermal IR (impact of Sun) 
- **Thermocline (~20 – 400 m):** 
	- steep temperature slope (low impact from surface processes: wind, sun) 
	- isolates deep layer from impact of temperature and wind
- **Deep layer (< 400–1000 m)** 
	- low temperature (~4°C) 
	- circulation: thermo-haline: slow! 
	- reaches surface in high latitudes 

# Circulation

## Surface

![[Pasted image 20240825160950.png]]
- mainly driven by wind 
- deviation by Earth rotation ([[Coriolis Effect]])

## Deep Ocean

![[Pasted image 20240825161039.png]]

- down-welling of dense, cold, salty water in polar oceans -> suction effect to surrounding inflowing water -> thermo-haline global conveyor belt

# Sea Level Change

Two effects are leading to the rise of global sea levels
- mass rise: sea level increases due to more water in the oceans from melting [[Cryosphere|ice]] and increased water runoff
- thermal rise: higher global temperatures lead to lower water density
