An axially symmetric body in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be created using a real and positive [[Function]] of one variable $f: z \in [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ which is then revolved around an axis.

## Surface Area

The surface area of the body is given by
$$
S = 2 \pi \int_{a}^{b} f(z) \cdot \sqrt{1 + f'(z)^{2}} \ dz
$$

# Volume

The volume of the body is given by
$$
V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} f(z)^{2} \ dz
$$
