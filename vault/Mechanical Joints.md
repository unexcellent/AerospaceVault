- Connecting elements of the [[Mechanical Supports|support]] system
- Differentiation between possible and hindered degrees of freedom
- Example of a swivel joint (moment joint)

# Types

## Swivel Joint

![[Pasted image 20231024104116.png]]

- allows horizontal and vertical force transduction
- but not moment forces

## Hull Joints

- are not connected -> can slide in and out of each other
- vertical forces and moments can be transduced
- horizontal forces can not

## Sliding Joints

- forces in horizontal direction and moments can be transduced
- vertical forces can not

# Computational Methods

- Cutting principle at each pin leads to two equilibrium conditions each.
- For statically determined trusses, all unknown bar and support forces can be calculated with it.
- Sign convention for bars must be observed.
- For simple trusses (triangles only), first calculate support forces, then continue at the node with only 2 unknowns
