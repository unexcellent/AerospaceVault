# Translational

Describes the relationship between [[Stress]] and [[Strain]] via the Young's modulus $E$ (a [[Material]] constant, also called modulus of elasticity) during the linear deformation regime:
$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$
-> $E$: [[Modulus of Elasticity]]
-> $\sigma$: [[Stress]]
-> $\epsilon$: [[Strain]]

$$
E = 2G(1+v)
$$
-> $G$: [[Shear Modulus]]
-> $v$: [[Poisson Ratio]]

# Rotational

$$
\tau = G \cdot \gamma
$$
-> $G$: [[Shear Modulus]]
-> $\gamma$: [[Rotational Strain]]
