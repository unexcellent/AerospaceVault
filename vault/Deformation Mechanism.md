# Elastic Deformation

Deformation that is only temporary and once the applied [[Stress|stress]] is released, the original shape of the body is restored.

# Plastic Deformation

Deformation in which [[Atomic Bonding|interatomic bonds]] are ruptured and then reformed. It most often involves the motion of dislocations (linear crystalline defects).

- The process by which plastic deformation is produced by dislocation motion is called slip
- The crystallographic plane along which the dislocation line traverses is the slip plane
- The cause of plastic deformation is the sliding of rows of atoms on slip planes

## Process

- In ideal crystal, ~1000 - 3000 MPa would be necessary to be able to slide one atomic plane.
- In reality, this value is significantly lower, because the planes do not slide as a whole but individually
