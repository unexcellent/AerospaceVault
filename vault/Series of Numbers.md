A series is the operation of adding a [[Sequence of Numbers|sequence]] $a_{k}$ infinitely many times.
$$
\sum^{\infty}_{k=k_{0}} a_{k}
$$
with $k_{0} \in \mathbb{N}$.

# Convergent Behaviour

A series can either:
- [[Series Convergence|converge]] if it approaches a finite value
- definitely diverge if it approaches $\pm \infty$
- indefinitely diverge if it oscillates
