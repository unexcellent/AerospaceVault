Absorption describes the process of [[Electromagnetic Radiation|light]] transferring its energy to an object.

- Photons from incoming light hit [[Atom|atoms]] and molecules and cause them to vibrate. 
- The more an object's molecules move and vibrate, the hotter it becomes. This [[Heat]] is then emitted from the object as thermal energy. 
- Darker colored objects, absorb more incident light energy than others. 
- The color of an object is the wavelengths of the light [[Light Reflection|reflected]] while all other wavelengths are absorbed.
