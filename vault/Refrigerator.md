A refrigerator is a device that extracts [[Heat]] from a source that is colder than the target using [[Thermodynamic Work]]. It is the reverse of the [[Carnot Cycle]].

# Refrigerator Cycle

![[Pasted image 20240821122352.png|350]]

- **1 → 2**: Decreasing the temperature from $T_{amb}$ to below $T_{cool}$ by expansion 
- **2 → 3**: [[Heat Conduction|Heat transfer]] from the inside of the fridge to the refrigerant 
- **3 → 4**: Increasing the temperature to above $T_{amb}$ by compressing the refrigerant using external, mostly electrical work 
- **4 → 1**: [[Heat Conduction|Heat transfer]] from refrigerant to ambient air

# Efficiency

The [[Thermal Efficiency]] of a refrigerator is characterized by the coefficient of performance $\beta$.
$$
\beta = \frac{Q_{out}}{W_{in}} = \frac{T_{C}}{T_{H} - T_{C}}
$$
-> $Q_{out}$: supplied [[Heat]]
-> $W_{in}$: Energy cost
-> $T_{H}$: [[Temperature]] of the target
-> $T_{C}$: [[Temperature]] of the source
