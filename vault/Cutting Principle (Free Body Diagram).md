- multiple elements, that transduce [[Force|force]] onto one another can be displayed apart from one another
- active forces are physically given (like weight force, wind)
- reaction forces result from impediments of freedom of movement (like [[Mechanical Supports|support]] forces)
	- reaction forces must be cut free from the primary element

- if the support acts in multiple directions (like $A$), then multiple reaction forces have to be added
