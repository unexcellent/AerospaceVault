Symbol: $W_{i}$

[[Mechanical Work]] of internal [[Force|forces]] distributed throughout the body. 

The internal work is always negative.

# From [[Torsion]]

$$
W_{int} = - \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{l} \frac{M_{T}^{2}(x)}{G \cdot I_{T}} dx
$$
-> $l$: total length
-> $M_{T}$: [[Torsional Moment]]
-> $G$: [[Shear Modulus]]
-> $I_{T}$: [[Torsional Moment of Inertia]]
-> $x$: distance to the fix point of the cylinder along the rotation axis

# From [[Bending]]

$$
W_{i} = \frac{1}{2} \int^{l}_{0} \frac{M^{2}}{EI} dx
$$
