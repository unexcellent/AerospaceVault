An [[Electric Circuit]] with an alternating [[Current]] and [[Voltage]].

![[Pasted image 20240807135227.png]]

It is defined by the voltage and current amplitudes $\hat{V}$, $\hat{I}$, the angular velocity 
$$
\omega = 2\pi \cdot f = \frac{2\pi}{T}
$$
-> $f$: frequency
-> $T$: period

and the voltage and current phase shifts $\gamma$.

# Vector Diagram

The vector diagram is a method of visualizing the phase shifts and amplitudes on a circular with constant angular rotation $\omega$
