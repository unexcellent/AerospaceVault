Symbol: $E$

# Definition

Original definition via the [[Force|force]] between the plates caused by the charge.
$$
E = \frac{F}{Q} = \frac{V}{d}
$$
-> $F$: [[Force]]
-> $Q$: [[Electrical Charge]]
-> $V$: [[Voltage]]
-> $d$: Distance

# [[Force]] in the Electric Field

## Force on Metallic Surfaces

Energy content:
$$
W_{el} = \frac{1}{2} QV
$$

Law of energy conservation:
$$
dW_{el} = dW_{mech}
$$

Mechanical Force:
$$
F = \frac{dW_{el}}{dl} = \frac{1}{2} QE
$$
Mechanical Force Density:
$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{1}{2} DE = w_{el}
$$

## Forces on Insulators

Interface displacement by $dl_{1}$:
$$
dW_{mech} = F \cdot dl_{1} = dW_{el}
$$

Mechanical Force:
$$
F = \frac{dW_{el}}{dl_{1}} = \frac{d}{dl_{1}} (\frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^{2}}{C_{tot}})
$$
