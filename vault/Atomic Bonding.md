Methods of how solids are formed from [[Atom|atoms]].

Interaction between two atoms can be idealized by a sphere-spring model.

# Types

## Ionic Bonding

![[Pasted image 20240529185425.png|500]]

- Atom of high electronegativity takes an [[Electron]] of an atom of lower electronegativity (difference > 1.8)
- Difference in [[Electrical Charge|charge]] cause the atoms to form a crystalline structure
- Ionic [[Material|materials]] characteristically have low [[Toughness]] and low thermal and [[Electrical Conductivity]]

## Covalent Bonding

![[Pasted image 20240529190038.png|500]]

- In covalent bonding two [[Atom|atoms]] each share at least one valence [[Electron]] to the bond
- Stable electron configurations are assumed
- Covalent bonds are directional and belongs only to sharing atoms
- Covalent bonds may be of high energy and are stable
- Atoms must be of similar electronegativity (difference < 1.7)
- Atoms must provide a electronegativity larger 1.5
- Orientation and distance of atoms are fix defined for covalent bonds

## Metallic Bonding

![[Pasted image 20240529190453.png|500]]

- In [[Metalic Material|metals]], the valence [[Electron|electrons]] are shared in a kind of sea or cloud (electron gas)
- The positive charged [[Atom]] cores form a lattice structure
- Type of involved atoms are influencing the type of lattice structure

Metallic bonds are in direct correlation to material properties, well known from metals:
- good [[Electrical Conductivity]]
- high thermal conductivity
- good deformability between lattice planes
- high chemical reactivity (e.g. corrosion)
- The metallic bond is usually weaker than the covalent and the ionic bond (e.g. lower [[Hardness]] compared to [[Ceramic Material|ceramics]])

## Van-der-Waals Bonding

![[Pasted image 20240529190841.png|500]]

- Bonding results from the [[Coulomb's Law|coulombic]] attraction between the positive end of one dipole and the negative of another one
- Polar Molecules are determined by their asymmetrical arrangement of their positively and negatively charged regions
