Diodes are a basic element of an [[Electric Circuit]] made from [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]], which only allow [[Current|current]] flow in one direction.

# Diode Equation

$$
I_{D} = I_{S} \cdot (e^{\frac{V_{pn}}{V_{T}}} - 1)
$$
-> $I_{D}$: Diode [[Current|current]]
-> $I_{S}$: Saturation [[Current|current]]
-> $V_{pn}$: [[Semiconductor#P-N Junction|p-n junction]] [[Voltage|voltage]]
-> $V_{T}$: Temperature [[Voltage]]

# Operating Principle

Diodes use the properties of the [[Semiconductor#P-N Junction|p-n junction]] by applying different [[Voltage|voltages]].

If $V_{pn}>0$ the [[Diffusion Current]] dominates which results in [[Current|current]] flow.
If $V_{pn} < 0$ the [[Drift Current]] dominates, which results in blocked [[Current|current]] flow.

# Breakdown Mechanisms

When the voltage in the reverse direction is high, the current increases sharply above a certain value.

## Avalanche Breakdown

Charge carriers generated by electron-hole pairs lead to even more electron-hole pairs by collisions with atoms of the grid.

## Tunnel or Zener Breakdown

High doping results in a small depletion region, allowing charge carriers to tunnel directly from the [[Band Model|valence band]] into the [[Band Model|conduction band]].

## Thermal Breakdown

Destruction of the component if the permitted power dissipation of the diode is exceeded.
