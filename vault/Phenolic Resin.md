Part of the [[Thermoset]]-group.

# Properties

- Properties strongly dependent on type and quantity of fillers and reinforcements (resin carrier) 
- Reasons for the addition of resin carriers (e.g.: powder form, fiber and chip form, web or mats):
	- Absorption of the moisture contained in the molding compounds
	- Reduction of shrinkage
	- Increase of mechanical properties 
- [[Stiffness]] and [[Hardness]] very high compared to other polymers 
- Low [[Creep Testing|creep deformation]]
- Application limits: up to 110 °C (organic resin carrier) or 160 °C (anorganic resin carrier) 
- Yellow to brown color 
- Favorable fire properties 
- Accounts for about 1/3 of the market for curable molding compounds

# Applications

- Electronics 
- Household appliances 
- Mechanical engineering and vehicle construction 
- Aerospace and public transportation: Interiors
