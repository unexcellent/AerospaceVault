# Solid

- Strong forces between molecules
- Solid connection to neighbouring molecules 

# Liquid

- Strong interaction between neighbouring molecules
- Roughly constant molecular distance 

# Gas

- No connection between neighbouring molecules
- Elastic collisions between molecules
- No or only small intermolecular forces

The $p$-$v$-$T$ [[Regular Surface|surface]] is a 3D graph displaying all states of matter.

The Triple Line is a straight line on the $p$-$v$-$T$. Only on the Triple Line, all three states of matter can coexist.
