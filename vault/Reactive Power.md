Symbol: $Q$

Reactive power is a measure of the transferred [[Electrical Power]] in an AC circuit at passive components like [[Inductance|inductances]] and [[Capacitor|capacitors]].
$$
Q = \frac{\hat{V} \cdot \hat{I}}{2} \cdot \sin(\varphi_{V} - \varphi_{I})
$$
-> $\hat{V}$: [[Voltage]] amplitude
-> $\hat{I}$: [[Current]] amplitude
-> $\varphi_{V}$: Voltage phase shift
-> $\varphi_{I}$: Current phase shift
