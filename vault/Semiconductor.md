Semiconductors are [[Material|materials]] which, in contrast to conductors or insulators, can conduct and insulate. The [[Electrical Conductivity|conductivity]] is between those of conductors and insulators.

# N-Doped Semiconductors

Replacing a silicon atom with a pentavalent element (e.g. phosphorus), so that the fifth electron has only a small [[Band Model|band gap]] and can therefore be easily detached from the atomic core.

This results in more free electrons than holes, meaning electrons are the majority charge carriers.

# P-Doped Semiconductors

Replacing a silicon atom with trivalent element (e.g. boron). The [[Band Model|band gap]] to the valence band is then very small, so an electron is very easily absorbed.

This results in more holes than free electrons, meaning holes are the majority charge carriers.

# P-N Junction

The connection of a p-doped region and an n-doped region results in a [[Diffusion Current|diffusion motion]] of the electrons toward the p-doped region and the holes toward the n-doped region.

The electrons of the n-doped region, which are easily detached from the atomic bond, settle on the holes of the p-doped region. They thereby leave a positive charge in the n-region and in turn generate a negative charge in the p-region.

This results in the formation of a depletion zone.

The creation of an [[Electric Field]] invokes a [[Drift Current]], which counteracts the [[Diffusion Current]].
