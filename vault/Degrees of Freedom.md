# Equilibrium Conditions

In statics, motion must be constraint.

## In 2D

3 degrees of freedom lead to 3 equilibrium conditions for static systems
- $\sum F_{x} = 0$
- $\sum F_{y} = 0$
- $\sum M_{xy} = 0$

## In 3D

6 degrees of freedom lead to 6 equilibrium conditions for static systems

$$
\sum F_{x} = \sum F_{y} = \sum F_{z} = 0
$$
$$
\sum M_{x} = \sum M_{y} = \sum M_{z} = 0
$$
