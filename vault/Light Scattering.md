- Light hits an object and bounces off in a variety of directions. 
- The amount of scattering that takes place depends on the wavelength of the light and the size and structure of the object. 
- Blue lights scatters about six times more than red. This scattering of light at shorter wavelengths illuminates the skies -> blue sky
