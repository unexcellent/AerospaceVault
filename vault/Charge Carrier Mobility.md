The charge carrier mobility factor $\mu$ defines the mobility of charge carriers in an [[Electric Field]].

It is approximately constant at lower field strengths, but decreases with increasing field strength due to increased scattering. Similarly, it decreases with increasing [[Temperature]] and doping density.
