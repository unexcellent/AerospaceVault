The [[Magnetic Flux|magnetic flux]] density (also called B-field) describes the [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] [[Vector|vector]], which causes a [[Force|force]] on a particle in the field, as stated by the [[Lorentz Law]].
$$
\overrightarrow{B} = \mu_{0} \cdot \mu_{r} \cdot \overrightarrow{H}
$$
-> $\mu$: [[Permeability]]
-> $H$: [[Magnetic Field]]

# Unit

Tesla $[T]$:
$$
T = \frac{N \cdot s}{C \cdot m} = \frac{Wb}{m^{2}}
