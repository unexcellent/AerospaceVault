A [[Material]] constant describing the ratio of shear stress to shear strain
$$
G = \frac{\tau_{xy}}{\gamma_{xy}}
$$
-> $\tau_{xy}$: [[Stress|shear stress]] in $xy$-direction
-> $\gamma_{xy}$: [[Strain#Shear Strain|shear strain]] in $xy$-direction

$$
G = \dfrac{E}{2(1+v)}
$$
-> $E$: [[Hookes Law]]
-> $v$: [[Poisson Ratio]]
