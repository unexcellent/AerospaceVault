- MOSFETs also have three terminals, but they are labelled differently: Gate (G), Drain (D) and Source (S).
- Analogous to [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|bipolar transistors]], there are also three basic circuits for MOSFETs:
	- source circuit (corresponds to the emitter circuit),
	- drain circuit (corresponds to collector circuit) and
	- gate circuit (corresponds to the base circuit).
- MOSFETs are distinguished into n-type and p-type according to their internal structure.

- The structure of the MOSFET differs from the bipolar transistor.

- The gate is connected to the doped regions of the transistor via an insulating layer.
- When a [[Voltage]] is applied to the gate, the insulated connection effects an [[Electric Field]] between the drain and source, allowing or preventing [[Current|current]] flow.
- At low frequencies at the gate input, the MOSFET hence requires a very low power.

- As for the bipolar transistor, characteristic curves can also be recorded for the MOSFET.
- It also works in three ranges:
	- Ohmic/triode range (I)
	- Saturation range (II and III)
	- Breakdown range (IV)
- The linkage between the drain current ID and the drain-source voltage VDS for different values of the gate-source voltage VGS can be seen in the following characteristics.
