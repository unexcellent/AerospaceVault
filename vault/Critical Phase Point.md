When [[Heat]] is applied to a [[States of Matter#Liquid|liquid]], the [[Temperature]] rises until the [[Saturation Temperature]] is reached. At that point, the temperature stays constant until the entire liquid has [[Vaporization|vaporized]].
With increasing [[Pressure]], the temperature plateau becomes smaller. The **critical point** is reached when the plateau is infinitesimal and no heat is required for the phase transition.
