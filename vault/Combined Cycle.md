# Efficiency

The [[Thermal Efficiency]] of the combined cycle benefits from the [[Heat]] transfer between the two cycles.
$$
\eta = \eta_{B} + \eta_{R} - \eta_{B} \cdot \eta_{R}
$$
-> $\eta_{B}$: [[Thermal Efficiency]] of the [[Brayton Cycle]]
-> $\eta_{R}$: [[Thermal Efficiency]] of the [[Rankine Cycle]]
